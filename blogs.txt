<p><strong>Kevin Volpp:</strong> The Affordable Care Act has had some noteworthy successes, and it leaves some areas with room for improvement. In terms of the notable successes, I think the biggest is it’s successfully covered more than 20 million people. That has a lot of important implications in terms of reducing inequality, reducing the risk of bankruptcy among people in those families. It’s also been widely credited with reducing the deficit based on how it was funded. I think the other key thing is that it’s made health insurance coverage more comprehensive. There are some mandates that are part of the Affordable Care Act — for example, removing pre-existing conditions as a reason people can be denied coverage or required to pay more, and allowing people to have their kid still part of their coverage until age 26. In many people’s minds, those are important provisions in their own right.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Why did you and your co-author, Jonathan Skinner, look at this from the viewpoint of behavioral economics?</p>
<p><strong>Volpp: </strong>I think a big part of the Affordable Care Act, in terms of increasing coverage, was to think about the underlying incentives of why people are not buying coverage. For many people, it frankly just comes down to weighing the expected costs and benefits in the short term, and concluding that the short-term benefits to people who weren’t buying coverage were less than what their coverage would have cost.</p>
<p>The way the Affordable Care Act tried to deal with that was by subsidizing the cost of coverage by providing people who are low income with fairly generous subsidies. That’s a carrot-type incentive. In addition, they included a stick-type incentive in the form of an individual mandate, whereby people were required to buy insurance. If they didn’t buy insurance, they’d have to pay a financial penalty. One thing we could critique is that this mandate probably wasn’t strong enough. It started out at about $200. Eventually it became about $700. That’s much less than the cost of the cheapest plan. An individual could quite rationally conclude, “I’m willing to pay a $700 penalty. I’m not willing to pay $4,000 or more for my coverage.”</p>
<p>The other issue was that there’s a time delay in terms of people paying this penalty. Often, it would not kick in until you paid your taxes roughly a year and a half later. That isn’t so desirable from a behavioral standpoint because people very much focus on immediate consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting issue from a philosophical standpoint. The individual mandate was originally an idea hatched by Republican think tanks. It really appealed to a lot of people from the sense of a personal responsibility here that could apply to each citizen, whereby if we’re going to have an individual insurance market function, we have to have everybody in the pool. The underlying challenge is what economists call an adverse selection problem, whereby individuals know more about their health than the insurer does, and people who are above-average risk will be more likely to buy coverage for a given price than people who are below-average risk. Over time, that leads to premiums climbing faster and faster because the lower-risk people differentially decide not to buy coverage. In essence, that’s what we’ve been seeing as the Achilles’ heel of the health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, that over time in certain markets lower-risk people are choosing not to buy insurance at higher and higher rates, which drives up the average premium more than might be seen as sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How do you think that problem needs to be approached so you can have more healthy people involved in the plans without enforcing a fine?</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> I think there are a number of ways this could be approached. If I were starting from scratch, I would consider having a stronger individual mandate and making that similar in price to the lowest-price plan. That way, everybody would have to do it. The issue becomes one of affordability and whether the carrot incentive is a subsidy or a tax credit. Whatever we might label it, those would have to be large enough so that lower-income families could actually afford the plan.</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the problems the Affordable Care Act has not solved, and which a lot of people would love to see solved, is the complexity of the health insurance system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I think there are other ways we could try to approach this that would increase the likelihood that people who have coverage will continue coverage, even if the individual mandate goes away. One of the principles we talk about in the article is the behavioral economic principle around inertia, and this underlies a lot of the power of default. In essence, there’s a status-quo bias that a lot of people experience. When they have something, it’s much harder to give it up than it is to acquire something fresh. If you have people opt out of something, typically enrollment rates are in the 90% range. If people have to opt into something, enrollment rates are often in the 10% range. The way you might think about this in context is we could have a form of automatic re-enrollment in a plan, where you could peg the plan to the price of the lowest subsidy or tax credit that’s being offered. You could basically say, “Here, you automatically have this plan. It’s free and you can opt out, but then you’re going to lose your coverage and the subsidy.” But I think very few people thinking rationally would do that. Why would you turn down a free health insurance plan?</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>On the other hand, if you think about this in an opt-in framework, which is the way it has been structured until now, this information is all out there but you have to find it. You have to make the effort to go sign up, you have to go through that process, you have to sift through all the information, and you can see why that naturally would lead to a lower enrollment rate.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> It’s a safe assumption that most Americans want it to be as simplified a process as possible. They don’t want to have to spend several days working through a website to find the right health coverage for them. They would like it put it on a silver platter for them.</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> I think that’s exactly right. One of the problems the Affordable Care Act has not solved, and which a lot of people would love to see solved, is the complexity of the health insurance system. It’s tremendously challenging for people to navigate. Many people don’t really understand their health insurance benefits very well. They get a guide to benefits that might be 70 pages long, has a lot of detail. That’s something which I think should be an important priority going forward.</p>
<p>We’ve done some work with Humana on trying to think through that. We actually designed a new health plan with them that’s called Humana Simplicity. It’s simple in a couple of important ways. One is that people don’t understand co-insurance deductibles or maximum out-of-pocket limits very well. They have a lot of difficulty calculating the expected costs of their care. We designed a plan that’s copayments only and has six categories of copayments. Everything is distilled down into those categories. Instead of having a 70-page guide to benefits, everything fits on a page and a half.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Can we ever get to a simplified system like that across the entire body of health care?</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> It’s a really good question. If it were easy, then obviously, this would have happened by now. I’m seeing more and more efforts to use design-type thinking and really move towards thinking about how to put the patient at the center of things. For example, there is an interesting initiative in some places that are being built as new facilities to eliminate waiting rooms. But in most facilities, a lot of the space being built is waiting rooms because there’s a lot of time waiting. If you can eliminate those waits, that’s much better for the patient. It requires a whole different model in terms of flow to accommodate that.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s really quite striking that before the Affordable Care Act came into play, we had about 45 million people in the U.S. who didn’t have coverage.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> One of the behavioral economic principles that you talk about in the article is instant gratification. People want that immediate feeling of having something fantastic right at their fingertips.</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> Instant gratification is really one of the deepest human tendencies. It probably dates from evolutionary days, when people were running away from saber-tooth tigers. But it is important as you design these programs to think about how people’s desire for immediate gratification influences their choices. In the context of the Affordable Care Act, this has two important implications. One is that from an economic standpoint it makes sense for people to just have coverage for catastrophic events. That’s the lowest-priced coverage. It protects you against financial disasters. But that doesn’t do so well in terms of immediate gratification because people see themselves paying these premiums and feeling like they’re not getting anything for it. I think if you were an economist designing a plan, you’d say, “Let’s put everyone in a low-cost catastrophic-only coverage plan.” That’s the most affordable way to do this, and I think that makes sense from the standpoint of insuring the population against catastrophic risk. But at the same time, we have to recognize that won’t quite satisfy a lot of people because even though they’re getting a lot in terms of financial security, that’s not going to be tangible.</p>
<p>I think the other issue that’s relevant, in terms of thinking about the new proposals that are being deliberated now, is the idea of having a continuous coverage requirement in lieu of the mandate. The idea is that if people don’t maintain continuous coverage, they would face a financial penalty of 30% of the premium when they sign up for coverage later. I think the problem with that is it fails the immediate gratification test. If we’re having trouble getting young, healthy people to sign up now because of the penalty that exists, a penalty that would kick in at some future point is very unlikely to work because that’s not going to be salient to people today.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> The subsidies are important to be able to have this type of program going forward. But a lot of people will say, “This is an unbelievable cost that the American public is having to pay for.” How do we get past that issue?</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> That’s a very deep question that relates to what kind of country do we want to be in terms of how we care for those who are less able to care for themselves? When we compare ourselves with various Western European countries, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, they’ve all figured out how to do this. In some sense, the only way to do it in terms of lower-income people is to have cross-subsidization from higher-income people who can support that. It’s really quite striking that before the Affordable Care Act came into play, we had about 45 million people in the U.S. who didn’t have coverage. We still have 20 million to 25 million. I think it does take its toll in various ways to have a lot of uninsured people in the U.S. But there’s no question that if we are going to provide coverage to more people who can’t afford it on their own, it will cost money.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>You talk about the fact that other countries have figured this out. Is the fact that our system is so expansive and has so many tentacles the main reasons why we are not able to be able to implement something like what you see in those countries?</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> I think the single biggest reason is that health care in the U.S. is significantly more expensive than anywhere else. It’s really quite striking. If you look at a graph of how spending in the U.S. has changed relative to life expectancy, and you compare us with the 26 countries we’re commonly compared with, we all start at the same place. On this graph, let’s imagine you have life expectancy on the Y axis, spending on the X axis. The U.S. basically goes up and then curves to the right, and we sort of stand by ourselves in terms of how much we spend. But life expectancy has actually improved a lot more in the other countries. So, we’re in this strange situation where we rank first in spending by a wide margin and rank 26th in life expectancy. You don’t need to be a business strategist to conclude that that’s not a very good return on investment in terms of the money that we spend on health services. If we spent 30% less per capita, then it would be much easier to provide coverage to everybody.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If we spent 30% less per capita, then it would be much easier to provide coverage to everybody.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>With so much of this in flux right now, this becomes a watch and wait for you and others in this realm, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> Yes, there’s a lot of concern that the proverbial baby will be thrown out with the bathwater. There are a lot of good things in the Affordable Care Act. I think the biggest remaining challenge is this issue of higher-risk people buying insurance at higher rates, lower-risk people buying no insurance, and that leading to premiums increasing more in some markets than is sustainable. That is a problem that could be solved in isolation, but unraveling the whole system creates a lot of uncertainty for all the insurers. And that in itself becomes a problem because a lot of them may then pull out of these markets, and then we don’t have a market.</p>
<p>Ideally, there would be a bipartisan effort that would say, let’s build on what’s been done. The Affordable Care Act is actually a market-based solution. It’s very far away from what Democrats have proposed in the past. It’s not at all like a single-payer kind of system. It’s saying, “Let’s create these marketplaces, the individual insurance market. Let’s try to figure out how to make that work better. We have to provide subsidies to people that make the insurance coverage affordable.” I think that’s common to how people across the political aisle would think about this. Where there are differences now are in things like how big are these subsidies or tax credits, and how strongly do we feel we can help people to participate? Is there an individual mandate? Is there not an individual mandate? If we don’t have the individual mandate, what are the alternatives? As I mentioned, I don’t think this continuous coverage requirement is going to work. I think it fails the behavioral test in terms of people making decisions based on immediate costs and benefits, as opposed to those they would only face at some point down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Going back to the inertia principle that you talked about before, with the baby boomer generation getting older and needing advanced health care, it becomes even more important to have the younger generation to level the field.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Subsidies alone probably will not work in terms of getting sufficient people to enroll in these marketplaces.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> I think that’s fair. Health care has always been an 80-20 proposition. So, 20% of people end up being responsible for probably about 80% of the costs. That is one of the underlying challenges here, particularly as you think about trying to make these individual marketplaces work. If you have a few very high-cost people, that obviously raises the average cost for everybody. One approach that Jonathan Skinner and I suggest in the article is really thinking a bit differently about the high-risk pools. Various groups have talked about the idea of pulling out the higher-risk people. If you pull out the higher-risk people, then this problem of the markets unraveling and the premiums progressively going up becomes much less of an issue because the higher-risk people are then no longer a part of that average cost. If we pull out the higher-risk people, you might actually see premiums go down for lower-risk people. Then where do we put the higher-risk people? One challenge is creating a separate pool for them. There’s a long history of those kind of pools not working very well. They tend to be underfunded. There’s not generally enough political will to support them. A good example of how we’ve done this well is what’s happened with people who are in end-stage renal dialysis, who basically just got folded into the Medicare program many decades ago. It relates to the issue of salience of taxation. It’s very hard to raise money separately for any kind of new, significant programmatic initiative. But if we just folded those high-risk people into Medicare, they’d be absorbed, they’d be a small portion of the Medicare population, and their average cost would be much lower.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> If you’re taking the high-risk people out, you have a second group with the lower-risk people. Then there isn’t as much of the economic burden on that group compared with keeping high-risk people in there.</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> That’s absolutely right. I think if we pulled out the 20% highest-risk people from the health insurance exchanges and we put them in Medicare, the average cost for the 80% of people who remained would be much lower than it is now. That makes insurance much more affordable. It makes it much more likely that more, lower-risk people would choose to buy insurance. And then you’d have a much better-functioning market.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Are we venturing into new ground in terms of how we’re thinking about these challenges?</p>
<p><strong>Volpp:</strong> I think a lot of the challenges are well known. Different groups trying to solve those challenges differ based on their beliefs, based on their political philosophy, and that’s where I think the mandate tends to get tripped up. There’s generally an acknowledgement that subsidies alone may not be enough to get people to sign up. There’s a well-documented literature in behavioral economics that carrots are weaker than sticks. People tend to be very loss-averse. Subsidies alone probably will not work in terms of getting sufficient people to enroll in these marketplaces. It’s possible that some combination of these approaches would help. But I think you still have this fundamental problem that in the current setting you have people having to opt in, you have subsidies only, you have a delayed penalty in terms of the continuous coverage requirement, and it just may not be salient enough for that young, healthy person who’s thinking, “I don’t want to pay this premium now for something that might or might not help me down the road.”</p>

						<p><em>Most U.S. employers now have incentive programs <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/workplace-health-incentive-programs-dont-work/">designed to nudge workers toward healthier choices</a>. But according to <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/asch/" target="_blank">David Asch</a>, who teaches both at Wharton and at Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine, most of those programs aren’t designed properly to deal with the human element. And perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that, given how irrational people really are, systems based on the apparent logic of classical economics sometimes miss the mark in getting us to do the right thing.</em></p>
<p><em>But those problems can be fixed. Asch spoke with Knowledge@Wharton about his research on behavioral economics in health care, how it could help companies develop better health incentive programs for their employees, and why the solutions are both more and less simple than you might expect.

<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>Can you give us a brief overview of your research?</p>
<p><strong>David Asch: </strong>For many American companies and American employers, even if they’re not in the health care business, health is central to what they do, because it keeps their workforce healthy — and because frankly, health care costs have an incredible impact on their bottom line. Everybody knows that health is determined so much by individual human behavior; we now have much better ways of motivating that behavior from principles of behavioral economics — principles that, frankly, employers have been a little slow to adopt.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>What are some of the key takeaways from your research in terms of how employers could use these principles to design better health incentive programs?</p>
<p><strong>Asch: </strong>First, let’s back up a little bit and ask: “Well, what are they doing?” I think so much of our approach to health — whether it’s from a doctor approaching health care, or an employer or an HR department thinking about wellness for their employees — is based on the principle of education. We should just “educate employees” that smoking is bad for them and that fitness is good for them, and they should be adhering to their prescriptions. It’s a very rational model, but it assumes that if our employees only knew what to do, they would do that.</p>
<p>As soon as you say those words, you realize how limited that approach really is. Because of course people do know that smoking is bad for them, but it’s very hard to quit. Or they start smoking in the first place. They know they should take their medications. So giving them education rarely is going to be enough to move the needle, yet so many programs that employers use are fundamentally based on that.</p>
<p>The next level that employers use is thinking about economic incentives: “Why don’t we give a reduction in health insurance premium or some kind of pay for performance approach to get employees to move forward?” And there is some evidence that that works. But the work that we do has been largely focused on different kinds of arrangements to help motivate either employees on the employer side, or patients in the clinical setting, to try to get people to take better care of their health — recognizing the psychological foibles and pitfalls that we all fall into.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see losses as more potent than gains. So let’s see how we can frame things as losses.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>So if I’m an employer and I’m trying to design an effective health incentive program, what are some conclusions from your research that might be a surprise to me as I’m sitting down trying to design this plan?</p>
<p><strong>Asch: </strong>A lot of the results are surprising, and they’re surprising because they’re sort of irrational. In fact, they take advantage of the fact that many of us don’t think in rational ways. Here’s an example of a recent study that we did; it was led by a colleague of mine, Mitish Patel. He, our colleague Kevin Volpp and I — we did this with a group of employees to try to get them to walk more. We did a randomized controlled trial, real science, thinking, how can we get employees to walk at least 7,000 steps a day?</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

	</div>
<p>One group was a control group. They just were given feedback about how far they walked. Some groups were paid. In this case we paid them $1.40 a day for every day in which they walked 7,000 steps. A third group got what we would call a loss framed incentive — exactly the same amount of money, $1.40 a day, which is $42 a month. What we did is we gave them $42 a month in a virtual account before it started, and we took $1.40 back for every day they didn’t walk 7,000 steps.</p>
<p>Now mathematically, those two incentive arms are the same, right? It’s $1.40 gained if you walk, or the failure to lose $1.40 if you walk. The same thing. It turns out those who got the gain incentive – those who were promised $1.40 for walking — didn’t walk any more than the control group. The group that got the same $1.40 framed as a loss incentive walked 50% more than the control group. It’s irrational. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s the truth. Real data shows that. And it’s consistent with theories of behavioral economics, but inconsistent with how a lot of employers or doctors think about the best way to take care of their patients.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>What are some of the underlying forces at work here? If I’m doing any sort of incentive program or employee health program, how can I think about this using behavioral economics to design something that will actually get the result that I want, which is healthier employees? What are some of these irrational ways of thinking that would help me out? What is the best way to make people do the things that we all know we <em>should</em> do, but that we don’t necessarily <em>actually</em> do?</p>
<p><strong>Asch:</strong> I think you just phrased it perfectly: How do we get people to do the things we all know we should do, but don’t do them anyway? As soon as you say that, you realize what strategies you have to use, because they’re not going to be the rational ones. Because you just gave a very rational argument: Of course I should do this. And the rational view is, well, then I’d do it. But of course, that’s not what really happens. So you have to move beyond the typical education-based solutions. I’m not against education; I’m a professor. I’m in the business of education. But it can be a bit of a decoy when something more effective might be in reach.</p>
<p>I think the answer to your question, the more direct answer to your question is to think, “What are the pitfalls we normally fall into?” One of them is what I just mentioned — we see losses as more potent than gains. So let’s see how we can frame things as losses. Another pitfall is that objects right in front of us or goals right in front of us are so much more salient, so much more meaningful than things far in the distance. This is why we don’t save enough for retirement. It’s why we eat that piece of chocolate cake right in front of us, even though we’re on a diet. It’s why we don’t take our blood pressure medicine even though we desperately want to avoid a stroke that might happen years later. All of these things reflect errors in which we focus too much on the present and not enough on the future.</p>
<p>How do we fix that? Well, can we accelerate the benefits? Can we create incentives today for taking my antihypertensive drug? Incentives today for not eating the chocolate cake? Incentives today for going to the gym? Not the incentive we would normally get, which is being a thinner, healthier person 10 years from now, or several months from now. Financial incentives are a way to do that. But there may be other incentives too — social incentives. If I set up a system to go to the gym with a buddy — we don’t need research to tell us this: People are more likely to go to the gym if they’ve made a little pact with a buddy to show up, because they feel guilty if they don’t show up. Those are social incentives, and those are very powerful also. Yet in health care, we often think of health care as so private that we don’t want to engage two people together with it. But we do that with so many other aspects of our life, and going to the gym or taking your medicines — it’s really not that private.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>One of the misperceptions that the research addressed that I thought was very interesting was the idea that, while education is obviously important and it’s obviously important to be transparent about what you’re offering someone and what you’re doing, sometimes it is possible to give people too much information, to throw so much at them that they actually miss what you’re actually trying to tell them or get them to do.</p>
<p><strong>Asch: </strong>Absolutely. There is a fine line between “enough information” and “too much information.” I think the best example for that is the health insurance plans that employers give to their employees. It’s April right now. The University of Pennsylvania has its benefits open season…. And I have to select the best health care plan for me and my family. Well, at Penn I spent 15 years as the director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. I have to think of myself as someone pretty knowledgeable about health insurance and health benefits, and I can’t figure out what the best health insurance plan is for me and my family. And the reason is, there are these complicated tables of deductibles and co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and HSAs and all of these other kinds of things. Each one of those is a financial incentive designed to try to help me move my health care in a particular direction. But I would submit that a set of financial incentives you don’t understand is a set of financial incentives that can’t be effective. It’s just too complicated. I think we need to greatly simplify our approach, which is designed largely by economists and actuaries, and turn it into an approach that’s understandable by humans.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Lots of our employees are smart and they can handle hard things. But why should we rely on that? We should be making it easy.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>I feel like sometimes companies don’t do this because they feel like they’re going to insult people’s intelligence — like, of course you can figure this out. Of course you want all this information. But maybe people really don’t. They just want to know what’s best for them really in the end. That’s all they want to know.</p>
<p><strong>Asch: </strong>Yes. I don’t think it would be insulting. I think I know a lot about health insurance, and yet it’s just complicated. And I’m busy. It’s not about cognitive demand or cognitive ability, it’s just more about the idea that we should be making it easy for people instead of relying on their ability to handle hard things. Lots of our employees are smart and they can handle hard things. But why should we rely on that? We should be making it easy.</p>
<p>So much of behavioral economics is about that. How do we make it so that it’s easier to walk? How do we make it so that it’s easier to take your antihypertensive medications to lower your blood pressure? Why do we have co-payments for antihypertensives? They’re not drugs of abuse. No one’s going to go and take lots of blood pressure medicine for the fun of it. We want people to take their blood pressure medicine. Why do we make it so hard for them to get that medication?</p>
<p>I think that once we take a step back, we can find lots of things that we’re doing that don’t have a good reason psychologically. We should be defaulting patients into automatic-refill plans so they don’t run out of their medications and fall off the wagon. There are lots of approaches. We just have to recognize: What are the steps required for certain goals? And, what are the psychological pitfalls that we all have as we approach those goals?</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>Health incentive programs have entered the cultural lexicon. It seems like every company has them. And if they don’t, they’re probably going to have one next year or the year after that. So, are the companies being thoughtful enough when they’re adopting these programs, or are they being adopted in a vacuum without anyone thinking about the particulars of that company, of its employee population, or how to design a program that doesn’t just work for the short term to get the company what it wants, but actually makes for people who are healthier in the long term?</p>
<p><strong>Asch: </strong>More than 80% of U.S. companies are using some form of financial incentive to promote the health of their employees and/or their spouses, dependents and the like. So it is widespread, and it’s probably going to grow more than that. What I think is interesting — and I don’t want to be too insulting, but I think that a lot of employers are not using these techniques as efficiently as they could. One of the reasons is, as I’ve alluded to, they’ve got too rational a perspective. The assumption is, “Well, I’m using economics to improve behavior, therefore I’m doing behavioral economics.” That’s not behavioral economics, that’s plain economics. Paying someone to do something is a highly transactional approach.</p>
<p>It becomes behavioral economics — and much more potent — when you use psychological tricks that require these little clever design elements. Actually, that’s not widely understood. Those little tricks take some experience, and it turns out that subtle differences — as I mentioned the framing of a reward as a gain or a loss, for example — a very subtle difference can have a huge impact. So unless you know what you’re doing, it’s actually hard to make use of behavioral economics in the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>What would you say sets this research apart from other research that’s being conducted on this topic?</p>
<p><strong>Asch: </strong>You know, there isn’t a lot of work that is currently being done in behavioral economics in health that combines work in the wellness space — How do I get people to walk more or to lose weight? — with our insights from clinical medicine — How do I take someone who already has an illness, let’s say, congestive heart failure, and get them to stay out of the hospital? We  acknowledge that we can learn something from both of those settings, and combine them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We don’t need research to tell us this: People are more likely to go to the gym if they’ve made a little pact with a buddy to show up, because they feel guilty if they don’t show up.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you’re an employer, for example, it’s easy and comfortable to think about wellness, but actually, wellness is not going to save you a lot of money in your employee group. That’s not where the money is. The money is in the very few employees that you have who have some serious illnesses. The ability to improve the health and health care of those employees is going to have a much larger effect on your bottom line than the important — but I would say highly diluted — effects of the wellness activities for your employees.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>What’s next for your research? Where are you going from here?</p>
<p><strong>Asch: </strong>We’ve done a lot of work on the use of financial incentives to motivate people, and again, financial incentives that are designed with psychology in mind, not just transactionally. There’s been tremendous success in identifying ways to manipulate financial incentives to motivate employees. I think we’re increasingly interested in using social incentives. People sometimes freak out about financial incentives: Are you paying people to lose weight or to stop smoking? It can seem a little creepy or like a little bit of a “nanny state.” But actually, I think people are much more motivated by the social interactions that they have. They want to feel good among their colleagues. They don’t want to be a deadweight. They care what other people think about them. And to the extent that we can harness those very legitimate and very pro-social emotions and apply them to health settings, I think we can advance individual and population health forward a lot.</p>
<p>One of the barriers to that has been, as I mentioned, that people have often thought of health and health care as very, very private. But if you were to watch what people say about themselves on Twitter or on Facebook, you would realize in an instant that actually, people are quite open about their health. I think that privacy is important, but honestly, it’s probably not as important as many people think it is.</p>

<p><em>An edited transcript of the conversation follows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Katherine Milkman:</strong> When we chatted recently, you told me that the book you originally pitched when you began the journey of writing this in no way resembled the book you actually wrote. How did the book you pitched morph into <em>Misbehaving</em>?</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><strong>Richard Thaler:</strong> I have an agent, John Brockman, who is an agent to many academic authors like Dan Gilbert and Steven Pinker, and he’s very good at conning academics into writing books. He pulled this trick on me. The book I was intending to write, the title was <em>Snags</em>. The idea was stuff we would trip on. I thought of it as a prequel to <em>Nudge</em>, using my George Lucas [Star Wars creator] strategy of writing things backwards.</p>
<p>The problem I had was I worked on it off and on for a couple of years, and the book had no spine. It had no organizing principle, unlike <em>Nudge</em>, which had really two core principles. One was libertarian paternalism and the other was choice architecture, and those held the book together. <em>Snags</em> was a collection of things that I found interesting. I stumbled around for a while and then I consulted with some of my friends who are professional writers, like Michael Lewis, and he encouraged me to try to write the book in the way I did, which was structured as more of a memoir. But it’s just a sneaky way of talking about behavioral economics and telling a lot of stories.</p>
<p><strong>Milkman:</strong> I think it works beautifully…. One of the things I wanted to ask you about is what you think the most important lessons are for business readers.</p>
<p><strong>Thaler:</strong> The book is really a story about disruption. I had an idea 40 years ago that there might be another way of doing economics, and it was a very subversive idea. I had to try to figure out a way to get tradition-bound economists to take my idea seriously and then to corrupt young people like you into carrying the flag. Lots of businesses are in the situation I was in 40 years ago. It’s not that I have a recipe, but I think it’s always good to read about somebody’s struggles and the mistakes they made along the way and some of the success — of what, why and where.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>But of course, what the book is really about is the field of behavioral economics and the evidence that supports it. I use the same terms that I used in <em>Nudge</em>, which is humans and “econs,” and the idea is that standard economics has this mythical creature, “homo economicus” that I call an econ for short, and nobody’s ever met an econ. Even economists aren’t econs. So these econs are super smart, have no emotions, no self-control problems. They go to the gym exactly the right amount of times. They drink exactly the right quantities and never binge on chocolate or booze and save exactly the right amount for retirement and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>They are also complete jerks. They would never leave a tip at a restaurant they don’t intend to go back to. Those people are fictional creatures, and I wanted economics to be about real people. The lesson for businesses is you are dealing with real people. Those are your customers, those are your employees, those are your bosses, and the better you understand how real people tick, the more successfully you will be able to accomplish your goals.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The book is really a story about disruption. I had an idea 40 years ago that there might be another way of doing economics.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Milkman:</strong> This book is really the story of successfully changing the way a lot of very smart, confident, stubborn people — traditional economists — see the world. I’m curious if you have any thoughts based on that about some of the most important transferrable lessons you’ve learned about how to convince colleagues what they’re missing and need to change their views.</p>
<p><strong>Thaler:</strong> The truth is that I don’t think I’ve changed anybody’s mind or, if so, it’s a very small number of people. Even the people who have changed their minds won’t admit they have changed their minds. As I alluded to earlier, my strategy has been to try to — I sometimes say, corrupt the youth — get young people interested in the fields who don’t have a vested interest in the way things have always been done. There’s a reason why start-ups, especially disruptive start-ups, like Google or Amazon or Uber, are full of young people. That’s because young people are not as wedded to the old fashioned ways of doing things. In some ways, I succeeded by not trying to change everybody’s minds, but by recruiting others to help build up a body of evidence. But the second answer would be in the end, the only thing that convinces anybody is data. So there were lots of excuses economists made for continuing with their ways.</p>
<p>My friend {Harvard economist] Matthew Rabin sometimes refers to these as “explain-away-tions” — which is a great line. They would say, “Okay, people make these mistakes in the lab, but if you raised the stakes, then everything is going to be fine.” Then we’re still emerging from a crisis that was caused by essentially everybody making mistakes about mortgages — lenders, borrowers, people who were securitizing loans. High stakes don’t make people smart. If there’s one important lesson from behavioral economics, it’s that. People make just as many mistakes when the stakes go up, maybe more.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My mantra is, ‘If you want to help people, make it easy.’”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Milkman:</strong> At the end of the book, you spend a little bit of time talking about where behavioral economics has had the biggest impact and why you think that is. I was particularly interested to learn that you felt behavioral economics has had the biggest impact on finance, where the stakes are extremely high. I was wondering if you could explain to our audience why you think that’s the case.</p>
<p><strong>Thaler:</strong> The reason is that finance has a combination of two things that made the debate more interesting and more focal. One is fantastic data. We have daily prices on stocks, going back to 1926 in the U.S. and other countries around the world, and we have theories, which make precise predictions. Many of those predictions turned out to be false.</p>
<p>It was possible to generate studies that just were right in your face. You say the following thing cannot happen, and it happened. In the academic field of finance, I think that’s why the field succeeded. There’s another part of finance where the field has had a big impact, and that’s in the design of retirement savings plans, like 401K plans. Here, it was basically taking the principles of behavioral economics — we’re dealing with humans — and then using what my friend Danny Kahneman calls “first grade psychology” to improve the plans, to incorporate things like automatic enrollment or what I call “save more tomorrow,” which is giving people the opportunity to commit themselves now to saving more later, like when they get the next raise, defaulting people into sensible investment plans. My mantra is, “If you want to help people, make it easy.” We’ve made a lot of progress in 401K plans on making them safe for humans.</p>
<p><strong>Milkman:</strong> I posted a call for questions to ask during this interview on Twitter, where you’re very active, and … I got lots of great suggestions. One was actually a repeat of a question that your friend, Danny Kahneman, a Nobel Laureate and behavioral economist, answered recently during an interview. He was asked, “What’s the behavioral bias or reliable error made by decision makers that you would remove if you had a magic wand?” Danny answered, “Overconfidence,” and his answer was widely discussed in the Twittersphere and the blogosphere. The question that I was asked to ask you is the same one. What bias would you remove if you had a magic wand?</p>
<p><strong>Thaler:</strong> It’s never a good idea to disagree with Danny. I think that would also be at the top of my list. Let’s add some related biases that contribute to overconfidence, like the confirmation bias. One of the reasons we’re overconfident is that we actively seek evidence that supports our views. That’s true of everybody, that’s part of human nature, so that’s one reason we’re overconfident; we’re out there looking for support that we’re right. We rarely go out of our way to seek evidence that would contradict us. If people want to make a New Year’s resolution, it should be to test their strong beliefs by asking what would convince them that they were wrong, then looking around and seeing whether they might find some evidence for that.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The evidence for hindsight bias is overwhelming, and this has huge managerial implications.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The other one would be a hindsight bias, a notion that was first introduced by Baruch Fischhoff, who was a graduate student of [University of Minnesota psychology professor] Paul E. Meehl. Hindsight bias is the [inclination to believe] that after the fact we all think things were obvious. Now, if you ask people, “What did they think 10 years ago was the prospect that we would have an African-American president before we would have a woman president?” People would say, “Oh, yeah, well, that could have happened. All you needed was the right guy to come along at the right time.” Or some people, of course, will say the wrong guy, but in any case…. In truth, no one thought that back then. The evidence for hindsight bias is overwhelming, and this has huge managerial implications because when managers evaluate the decisions of their employees, they do so with hindsight.</p>
<p>So some project failed and after the fact it’s obvious why it failed and it’s obvious that the employee should have thought of it. Whereas, before the fact, it wasn’t obvious to anybody; otherwise, we wouldn’t have done it. The advice I always give my students in dealing with hindsight bias is before big decisions, get everybody to write stuff down — including the boss — and agree on what the criteria are for good and bad decisions. That will help at least a little bit — after the fact — when things blow up. We’ll have it on record that nobody anticipated the fact that our competitor was going to introduce a better version of our great idea two months before the launch, and we had no way of knowing that was going to happen.</p>

						<p><em>Does ethnicity influence economics? Knowledge@Wharton investigates this issue with Derek Penslar, professor of Israel Studies at Oxford University and also professor of Jewish History at the University of Toronto. He has written a book about the history of the Jewish people and the group’s strong association with commerce, </em>Shylock’s Children: Economics and Jewish Identity in Modern Europe<em>. Penslar argues that there is no monolithic “Jewish economy.” Rather, certain forms of economic behavior persisted throughout the Jewish world that tended to repeat themselves in many situations, enhanced by a sense of unity among Jews from different regions.</em></p>
<p><em>An edited transcript of the conversation follows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: What do you think of pairing ethnicity with economics and looking at the two together? Because that can be a controversial idea.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: It can be very controversial. No matter how you approach it, it is sensitive. The fact is that until the 1930s, 1940s, it was very common for scholars, including Jewish scholars who were really embedded in their communities, to write about the relationship between the Jewish religion or Jewish nationality and Jewish economic behavior. Nothing wrong was attributed to it.</p>
<p>Anti-Semites were making outrageous comments about Jewish economic behavior or domination but Jews considered it a completely acceptable thing to do. And then came the horrors of the 1930s, 1940s — Nazism, the Holocaust. And in the wake of that, a lot of the language that had been used to talk about Jews as a kind of an ethnic unit and an economic unit was discredited. It was considered no longer appropriate to talk about Jews that way.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Even by Jews?</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: Even by Jews. And so, scholarship on the history of the Jews tended to focus on anything but economics. Religion was okay. Politics was okay. Culture was okay. But economics was taboo. Very few people wrote about economics — and just every now and then. In the last, decade or decade and a half, we now see young scholars two generations removed away from the Holocaust who are beginning to take the subject up again. After all, you can’t understand any kind of group behavior without economics.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s not a monolithic thing called ‘the Jewish economy’ that marches across space and time.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: So, enough time has passed it would seem.</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: I think enough time has passed. Although there are people who still are nervous about it because of the way that anti-Semites have made use of economic arguments to demean the Jews.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Let’s get into what some of these characteristics or features of the Jewish approach are and how they may differ from other cultures or other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: There’s not a monolithic thing called “the Jewish economy” that marches across space and time. But there are certain forms of economic behavior or economic culture throughout much of the Jewish world that seem to repeat themselves in many different circumstances.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know how far back to go. But certainly, by the time we get into the later Middle Ages up through early modern times — 20th Century — the most important thing really is this one sentence, which is that Jews throughout most of history have not been peasants or aristocrats. Throughout most of human history, most people, until recently, were peasants. They worked the land. They often couldn’t leave the land. And that doesn’t encourage economic innovation. It doesn’t encourage literacy. It doesn’t encourage numeracy. It doesn’t encourage entrepreneurship. And aristocrats are lords of the land. And they tended to be a warrior elite. And that also does not encourage innovation.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>So, who innovates in a society? The middle classes, the townspeople, the bourgeois or the burghers. Well, Jews have been for millennia primarily a people of townsmen. It might be a small town; it might be a large one. And they’ve worked in a mixture of crafts but also in commerce. When people are doing that generation after generation, they develop certain comparative advantages, whether it’s literacy or numeracy. And let’s not forget the fact that Jews are connected with each other across space. The Jew in one town in Poland has Jewish distant family from another part of Poland or from somewhere in Germany and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: But the Israeli economy has changed a lot over the last 30 years. It’s gone from largely taking a socialistic approach to the economy to a much more capitalistic approach. Can you talk about that change and how it came about, why it came about?</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: The Jewish world in Central Eastern Europe primarily was just overwhelmed by the possibility of revolution in the 19th Century. Capitalist revolution, transformation of economic relations, but also socialism, Communism, various movements on the left, and national movements. Zionism is, after all, a classic form of Jewish nationalism.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Scholarship on the history of the Jews tended to focus on anything but economics. Religion was okay. Politics was okay. Culture was okay. But economics was taboo.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re caught up with this idea of a revolutionary change in the Jewish people. So, Zionism, when it realized itself in the [formation of the] state of Israel in 1948, was very strongly dominated by — I wouldn’t say a socialist ideology as such, but one that had socialist elements where the state played a very major role in the development of the country and in the promotion of the nation. There was a lot of state-owned industry. There were severe limits on wages. So, for example, wage differentials between workers and say, physicians or professors, in the early state of Israel were quite minimal. There was this egalitarian ethos, not socialism per se, but social democracy.</p>
<p>And that was one kind of Jewish economy in that it was influenced by the very strong role Jews had played in the revolutionary movements in the early 20th Century. But that was Israel of one era –1950s, 1960s. It already began to loosen up in the 1970s and the 1980s. Israel becomes an industrial powerhouse, manufacturing textiles, developing medical technology [and others.] It was no longer making money selling oranges and grapefruit alone. There was a lot more to the Israeli economy. And then comes the privatization wave that began in the 1980s and has really continued to this day. State-owned industries are sold off and there’s a neo-liberal economy where Israel is now one of the world centers for investment from abroad and of economic innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: It’s seen as a world center for high tech innovation in particular, but also of all kinds of innovation. … I’m wondering to what extent the military in Israel has played a role in that development of high tech. How closely related are those two?</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: They’re very closely related [as] they are in pretty much any country. Take aerospace. It was developed in California in the United States from World War II on. … The internet came, after all, out of the U.S. military. So, that kind of connection is not unique to Israel.</p>
<p>The difference is that the United States has this massive economy. As big as the military is in the U.S., there’s also an enormous consumer-driven, business-driven economy. Israel’s a smaller country with a smaller economy and the military is far more pervasive. So, there’s a lot more direct applications of military technology to the private sector. [For example,] programming that was developed to help provide directional assistance to fighter aircraft might then become used in GPS for civilian automobiles. This sort of thing — the much more direct transfer of technology.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Over history, there’s been other groups that have had prominent merchant classes that also went to other parts of the world and established beachheads. I’m thinking of particularly the Chinese throughout Southeast Asia, where they are often some of the chief merchant classes in some of the big cities even today, although they are a tiny percentage of the population.</p>
<p>India’s another example where there’s been a lot of merchant activity, some of which has gone overseas. So, there’s a diaspora from India of business people. How are these groups similar to what’s happened in Israel and to Jews over the years? And how do they differ?</p>
<blockquote><p>“Israel shows every sign of continuing to be a world leader in many aspects of high tech.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: Well, there’s two different ways of answering the question. One is that Jews until really 1948 were almost like a periphery or a diaspora without a center. That is, spiritually, they had this notion of the land of Israel as their center but that wasn’t their physical demographic home. They were like a donut, as it were, but there’s no center in the donut. And they dealt with each other throughout the Jewish world. So, you’ve got that Jewish merchant in New York who’s got the colleague or relative in Cleveland and someone in Los Angeles. There’s a lot of horizontal integration.</p>
<p>Of course, something similar happened to, let’s say, Indian merchants throughout much of Africa, throughout British Africa. The difference is that there was a homeland. There was a homeland and although some of these Indian merchants never saw that homeland, some of them did. You have Mahatmas Gandhi, for example, who’s an attorney from Gujarat in India. But then he winds up making his career partially in South Africa. And then goes back to India. There is a center. There’s a place to go back to.</p>
<p>For the state of Israel, that only happened in 1948. … So, I’d say now the Israeli diaspora relates to Israel economically the way that the Indian diaspora or the Chinese diaspora of the past may have dealt with their homelands.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Israel, as I mentioned, is well known for being innovative, and in high tech in particular. Are there attributes of the Israeli economy related to that, that can be adopted or adapted by other countries that see that success, just as they would look at Silicon Valley and say, “How can we develop something like that in our country?”</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: Well, theoretically, yes. But it might be difficult because there are national cultures — there are ways of behaving. And if you look at Israel and the way, for example, the high tech sector works in Israel, there’s tremendous informality. There are authority structures, but they’re very loose. And you can challenge authority. You can challenge your boss. And things are much less well-organized. There’s a lot more improvisation. So, the question is whether these corporate cultures in other parts of the world are frankly willing to loosen up the way that Israel has.</p>
<p>Israelis also bring into the project a lot of intellectual independence. And one has to be willing to listen to a lot of that. So, it has to be much more of a group sort of decision-making process than an individualistic one. What I don’t know whether it can be translated as easily is the Israelis’ … very strong [sense of] solidarity, which keeps them united despite the often lack of strong authority structures. Israel has a sense [that they are facing a] common threat, whether it’s real or perceived is not the issue. There’s that sense. And there’s a sense of certain Jewish solidarity.</p>
<p>Whether one can replicate that in other parts of the world, I’m not sure. But the actual chain of command, the way decisions are taken on a daily basis, the way brainstorming takes place, yes, of course one could try to replicate that.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Any idea what the next iteration of the Israeli economy might look like? Are you seeing anything today that’s moving on, that’s a departure from what we tend to think about or think we know about the Israeli economy today?</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: Israel shows every sign of continuing to be a world leader in many aspects of high tech. But it’s not just that. The fact is, Israel does have competition and it’s not just from the United States and Canada; there’s the European Union. … And there is a concern in Israel that inadequate government funding — if the startup funding, for example, the investment funding that comes from venture capital, capitalists all over the world — if this were to dry up, then the Israeli startup economy would dry up. So, Israel in some ways is very vulnerable.</p>
<p>What I think might begin to happen is that Israel will become not only a leader in the development of new technologies, but the adoption of existing ones. Take desalination, which 30 years ago was considered outrageously expensive and simply impracticable. Israel is now adopting desalination that I think is providing up to 70% of the country’s drinking water – and it will actually have a water surplus in a few years. In the past, this would have been absolutely unheard of. And they’re using technology that is in part homegrown; a lot of it has come from elsewhere. So Israel’s innovation isn’t simply that they’re developing things at home. It’s also what they make use of what comes from the outside.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Is it even appropriate to ask these questions about the Jewishness of an Israeli economy?”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: What haven’t I asked you that would be interesting for viewers to understand about the Israeli economy?</p>
<p><strong>Derek Penslar</strong>: I think what would be really interesting to understand are two things. One is similarities and differences between the Israeli economy and its Jewishness — however we can define that — and American Jews. Because American Jews, by and large, are a very successful ethnic, religious minority. But it does not display, as an aggregate it seems, the same kind of thirst for innovation that one finds in the state of Israel. American Jews are by and large a comfortable and successful minority. And if anything, the innovative aspects of that community are being bled away by success. Fifty, 60 years ago American Jews were the first generations to go to university. They worked very hard. They had to be innovative to make it in the world. Whereas now they’re more comfortable and they can trod on well-established paths in business, in their professions. Whereas in Israel, there still is this kind of thirst to succeed.</p>
<p>The other thing I want to mention gets back to where we started: Is it even appropriate to ask these questions about the Jewishness of an Israeli economy? In other parts of the world — in China and in India — there’s much less embarrassment about talking about the relationship between culture and economics. Scholars of Indian studies simply do this all the time. What they’re careful about — and I would finish with this — is there’s a difference between saying that there can be a cultural influence behind economic behavior and some sort of determinant that people, because they belong to a certain ethnic community or identify with it, to be automatically blessed or cursed or pre-determined to succeed or to fail economically. There’s enormous parameters, enormous spectrum of possibilities. This is not an issue of race. This is not an issue of genetics. This is an issue of culture. Culture is fluid and organic and all we’re talking about is a field of possibilities, which in the case of Israel they’ve managed to realize.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why you succumbed, yet again, to advertising hype or deceptive packaging and overpaid for a product? Or bought securities that you know were overvalued when the herd instinct was just too strong to resist? </p>
<p>Such irrationality is the focus of behavioral economists, who appear to be gaining greater credibility in macroeconomic circles since the housing bubble of 2008 and the ensuing global financial meltdown. They are also at the center of an age-old debate recently reignited by columnist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman in a September 6 <em>New York Times Magazine</em> article titled, “How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?,”<span> which fires a salvo at the assumption underlying neoclassical economics — namely, that free markets are inherently rational and efficient. </span></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>Krugman’s article heaps scorn on so-called “freshwater economists” — as typified by the University of Chicago economics faculty, whose ideas have dominated government policymaking since the early 1980s. In contrast, “saltwater economics” exhibits more openness to the ideas promulgated in the 1930s by Britain’s John Maynard Keynes — that free markets often behave inefficiently, are self-destructive and at times need corrective policy actions such as government stimulus spending. Rather than ascribing perfect rationality to markets, these economists say people and institutions often behave irrationally and often in ways contrary to their own interests. </p>
<p>While the debate between the freshwater and saltwater viewpoints in macroeconomics may sound academic, it has a significant impact far outside the ivory towers of universities. First, companies rely on macroeconomic forecasting in their strategic planning and budgeting and for gaining insight about customers and competitors. And macroeconomic theory underlies much of government policymaking. Since the late 1970s, for example, the U.S. government’s deregulation of airlines, banking, utilities and communications grew out of a tacit belief in market efficiency and rationality. The Obama administration may be the first to seriously challenge efficient market assumptions since the Reagan era of the 1980s, amid its attempt to restrain executive compensation and set up a new consumer protection agency to govern credit and debit card practices. </p>
<p>The debate isn’t limited to the U.S., either. This year’s Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University, a political scientist, and Oliver E. Williamson of the University of California, Berkeley, an expert in conflict resolution, striking many economists as an international rebuke of the rigidly mathematical, rational-market models. “It is part of the merging of the social sciences,” Yale University economist Robert Shiller told <em>The New York Times</em>, echoing elements of Krugman’s argument. “Economics has been too isolated, and these awards are a sign of the greater enlightenment going around. We were too stuck on efficient markets, and it was derailing our thinking.”</p>

<p>There is no shortage of opinion on either side of the argument, including a lengthy blog by University of Chicago professor John Cochrane, who was one of Krugman’s most conspicuous targets. Cochrane’s blog asserts: “The case for free markets never was that markets are perfect… [but that] government control of markets, especially asset markets, has always been much worse…. Krugman at bottom is arguing that the government should massively intervene….”</p>
<p>Much of the debate will indeed be played out in the public policy arena. The rational behavior framework, dominant for the past 30 years, dictates one set of public policy conclusions — the wisdom of further deregulation, for example, coupled with fiscal restraint on the part of governments. But a new framework influenced by behavioral economics might dictate others — tighter regulation, say, in addition to continued stimulus spending and different taxation. “There is much to recommend what the neoclassicists have been doing for 30 years,” says Wharton business and public policy professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/tobacman.cfm"><font color="#0000ff">Jeremy Tobacman</font></a>. “But you have to be sensible and apply some intuition.” </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/stambaur.cfm"><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/stambaugh/" target="_blank">Robert Stambaugh</a></font></a>, a Wharton finance professor, cautions that the rational markets point of view is just a model, “and like any model, it’s wrong — because all abstractions are deficient to some degree. The greater question is, so what?” It could be that behavioral economics will be used more now to remedy the neoclassical model’s flaws because it offers rich new insights into human patterns of irrationality. Even so, Stambaugh doubts it will replace the rational behavior model altogether. “It may be that relying on market-based solutions is a bad idea and leads to all sorts of terrible things, but it’s like that saying about democracy — ‘the worst imaginable form of government except for all the others.’ And if beating up on the rational market view of the world becomes a way of justifying a greater degree of government intervention or some theory of non-market solutions, I think we need to be suspicious.” </p>
<p>According to Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel.cfm"><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a></font></a>, the freshwater market view of macroeconomics has dominated academic thinking and government policymaking in recent decades in part because behavioral economists haven’t been able to produce the same degree of analytical rigor as the rational economists have. Now that may be changing. Siegel sees the field of macroeconomic forecasting repositioning itself, with attempts at understanding how people form expectations and how periods of economic stability breed over-optimism and encourage high debt levels. “We may be moving toward a more behavioral, Keynesian way of viewing economic crises, and that would be a healthy change,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Rational vs. Irrational?</strong></p>
<p>The basic elements of the freshwater/saltwater debate are straightforward. The freshwater markets viewpoint rests strongly on the efficient markets hypothesis, or EMH, as propounded by the University of Chicago’s Eugene Fama in the 1970s and later bolstered by Chicago’s best-known neoclassicist, Milton Friedman. EMH argues that in any free market, competition among investors and entrepreneurs invariably drives prices to their correct levels. EMH does not assume rationality on the part of each player, merely on the part of markets as a whole. Therefore, the rationalists argue, free markets always make unbiased forecasts, even if they prove incorrect. EMH does not say the market price is always right, merely that it reflects all known information at any given moment.</p>
<p>Like a natural science, freshwater economics lends itself to complex, often elegant mathematical modeling. The freshwater view is that consumers, offered an array of choices, will select the one that is best for them — a straightforward assertion that can be neatly expressed in mathematical formulae. </p>
<p>In contrast, many assertions made in behavioral economics are more challenging to express mathematically. “Behavioralists” argue that consumers don’t always act in their own interests, especially when they fail to understand the choices on offer or succumb to irrational impulses involving those choices. For example, employers in the U.S. had been frustrated by the low participation of employees in company savings plans, despite the benefits the plans could offer the vast majority of workers. Employee participation jumped significantly when the government permitted companies to make savings plan enrollment automatic unless an employee checked a box to opt out of it. In other words, the government policy helped companies combat an employee’s negative impulse — but such impulses are inherently vague and difficult to define.</p>
<p>Unlike in freshwater economics, behavioral economics focuses primarily on the bounds of rationality. Behavioral economists assert that markets are often “informationally inefficient,” with much of the inefficiency stemming from patterns of irrational behavior that cognitive psychology can document and measure. In an article titled “Behavioral Finance,” published in the <em>Pacific-Basin Finance Journal</em>, Jay R. Ritter from the University of Florida notes that such patterns include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><em>Heuristics</em>, rules of thumb that people use to simplify decision-making, which are often misleading or wrong. </li>
<li><em>Overconfidence</em>, especially among entrepreneurs, who may believe too strongly in their own abilities so that they overleverage businesses and underdiversify risks. </li>
<li><em>Mental Accounting</em>, the separation of decisions that ought to be combined — for example, having one household budget for dining out and another for meals at home. </li>
<li><em>Representativeness</em>, the tendency to put too much weight on recent experience and not enough on long-term averages. A case in point: the belief in recent years that housing prices would only escalate, despite the contrary evidence of historic averages. </li>
</ul>
<p>So, does the recent economic crisis mean victory for behavioralists at the freshwater school’s expense? Yes and no, according to a sampling of Wharton faculty. “It has been a crisis for the entire economics field,” says operations and information professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/milkman.cfm"><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/kmilkman/" target="_blank">Katherine Milkman</a></font></a>, who specializes in behavioral decision making. Macroeconomics failed to predict last year’s historic meltdown, but equally, microeconomic precepts have long been the basis for aligning executive incentives with the interests of companies and their shareholders. Milkman argues that the misalignment of interests was a major cause of last year’s turmoil, but so was the immense complexity of mortgage derivatives and other financial instruments. “The assumption that we can perfectly anticipate future outcomes of highly complex systems is absurd,” she says.</p>
<p>While agreeing that macroeconomic forecasting has relied heavily on the rational behavior model in recent decades, Milkman does not believe that dependence was entirely misplaced. “In any field, it’s important to solve the biggest problems first,” she notes — and viewing people as optimal decision makers was the right way to begin. At the same time, she sees the recent failure of economic forecasting as having brought about a sea change. “Now, economics has gone from viewing humans as perfectly rational and consistent to saying, ‘People are inconsistent and flawed in making their decisions, but we can analyze the inconsistencies and factor them into a new model.'”</p>
<p><strong>A Call to Arms</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/wolfers.cfm"><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/jwolfers/" target="_blank">Justin Wolfers</a></font></a>, a Wharton professor of business and public policy, concurs that the downturn drew attention to important flaws, not just in the efficient markets model, but also more generally in macroeconomists’ understanding of the marketplace. “The fact that there could be large-scale banking panics, that there was a shadow banking system that the regulators didn’t have a lot to say about — these elements have <em>not</em> been a large part of macroeconomic theorizing over the past two decades,” he notes. However, the field of macroeconomics won’t necessarily radically alter its course as a result. True, says Wolfers, “there is widespread public anger directed at macroeconomists right now, but there is also widespread anger at the meteorologists every time it rains.” </p>
<p>According to Wolfers, “Most of the successes of economic policy of the last two decades remain intact. For example, economic theory is now widely accepted as a starting point for analyses of law, sociology, psychology and all sorts of social issues.” Nonetheless, he argues, macroeconomics needs to become both more data-driven and more empirical, with greater emphasis on how consumers and investors behave and make decisions. Public disillusionment with macroeconomic forecasting, he adds, should be a “call to arms” for all economists. “It’s clear that the downturn entailed important issues that all economists should be thinking about and that each subfield of economics — not just macro — has something to contribute.”</p>

						<p>Hydraulic fracturing, a process to release natural gas and oil from the ground, is the focal point of several controversies involving environmental law and policy, economic growth, and public health. Advocates see the process, known popularly as fracking, as a vast source of natural gas that can provide energy independence for the United States while potentially offsetting some of the many environmental downsides of coal, most notably high carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. Advocates also argue that fracking has the potential to spark a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing by boosting jobs based on lower-cost industrial inputs.</p>
<p>But those concerned with fracking’s environmental impact on air and water quality, along with its potential to delay adoption of more expensive sustainable energy sources, cite numerous reasons for limiting fracking’s development.</p>
<p>In an effort to illuminate some of the nuances of this energy debate, the Penn Wharton Public Policy Initiative recently held a seminar titled, “Fracking, Environmental Policy, and Economic Growth,” moderated by <a target="_blank" href="https://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/24555/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/lightsa/" target="_blank">Sarah Light</a>, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at Wharton. The other participants were: Kathryn Klaber, former CEO of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the largest organization representing companies involved in Pennsylvania’s natural gas drilling boom; Scott Perry, deputy secretary at the office of oil and gas management at the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p12620">Trevor Penning</a>, director of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>There are many concerns about the impact of hydraulic fracturing on public health, safety and the environment, Light noted at the beginning of the discussion. That is not surprising given that fracking involves the high-pressure injection of water and chemicals into the ground to split shale rock apart to release the hydrocarbon sources that had been locked inside. “The rhetoric is heated on both sides,” Light said. “Not only is there disagreement about policy choices, but there is also sometimes disagreement about the facts underlying those policy choices.”</p>

<p>Concerns about air and water safety have led officials in New York, Vermont and elsewhere to impose moratoriums on fracking. Other critics worry that fracking ultimately is a short-term economic fix that could, over the long term, crowd out investment in non-fossil fuels and sustainable alternative fuels, such as wind and solar energy, that find it difficult to compete on price. Some have noted that the relatively lower prices charged for energy produced via fracking do not reflect the substantial, negative environmental and health-related costs they impose on society and the environment. If those costs were accounted for, they say, then sustainable resources would look more price-competitive.</p>
<p><strong>‘A Significant Impact’</strong></p>
<p>The seminar discussion focused on answering three core questions about fracking in Pennsylvania: First, what economic impact does fracking have in the state? Second, what kinds of regulatory oversight exist statewide? And third, has there been enough research about the environmental risks to fully assess fracking’s impact on public health and safety?</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Klaber, who headed the Marcellus Shale Coalition until October 22, 2013, argued that fracking has had a positive economic impact. “You start with a lot of prep work [such as] leasing land, which has a huge economic impact on landowners in the U.S…. Well over a billion dollars has gone into securing those leases; by law, a minimum of one-eighth (12.5%) of the value of that gas goes to the landowners.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, “a lot of work goes on in preparing [and] identifying the site. A lot of biologists and [other] jobs in science” are created in that process, Klaber noted, adding that rig construction and moving companies also gain, as do landscaping companies, seed companies and numerous other suppliers of specialized services. Industries dependent on Marcellus Shale employed nearly 232,000 workers in Pennsylvania during the first quarter of 2013, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor &amp; Industry.</p>
<p>Beyond that, noted Klaber, more than $2 billion will flow “to the state [through] sales taxes, franchise taxes, corporate income taxes [and] property taxes. About 2,600 local governments are part of this development. All 67 Pennsylvania counties receive a portion of the impact fee, which is a brand-new tax” that generated more than $400 million in 2011-2012. “There really isn’t a corner of this commonwealth that hasn’t had a significant impact — including western Pennsylvania, which lost a lot from the steel industry’s decline — and southeast Pennsylvania, [which suffered] after refineries were abruptly closed down there,” Klaber said.</p>
<p><strong>Enough Oversight?</strong></p>
<p>Scott Perry of DEP noted that his agency oversees “every aspect of [drilling] pad siting, well drilling, waste disposal, transmission line gathering,” and so forth. “Our first primary concern is public safety, and the issue is the sound construction of these gas wells,” he said. “If they are not properly encased and cemented, you could have methane migration cases that pose a direct threat to public safety, in addition to groundwater quality issues.” However, he added, “There have been cases in the past where that [problem] has occurred, so we have acted swiftly to strengthen those rules.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are concerned about our data quality. We have justifiably taken a few beatings in the press over the quality of the data that we have.” <span class="attribution">–Scott Perry</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The agency’s second concern is public health risks, defined as chronic exposure to wastewater or air quality risks. The most significant rule that Perry’s office has adopted to address such issues is “the elimination of the discharge of the wastewater from shale gas development into Pennsylvania’s streams and rivers. This wastewater is very high in salts — and has high levels of barium and strontium (a naturally occurring radioactive material), and the facilities that have historically taken this wastewater do not have the treatment capabilities to remove these constituents.” The result: “We have not just avoided impact on our streams, but the cumulative impacts to our streams and rivers,” Perry stated. “Without any discharge at all, we are preserving the water quality throughout Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>Regarding air quality, Perry noted that the DEP has completed several short-term and one long-term study. Although the DEP has not identified any air pollutants of concern, it has strengthened requirements for permits involved with compressor stations and, for the first time, has established at-the-wellhead control requirements to reduce volatile organic compound and methane emissions. Additionally, the agency monitors earth-moving activities at oil and gas sites to avoid “erosion and sediment control problems, as well as post-construction storm water management,” Perry said.</p>
<p>However, Perry was quick to admit that his agency needs to improve its performance in some respects. “We are concerned about our data quality. We have justifiably taken a few beatings in the press over the quality of the data that we have. We want it to be transparent so the public knows exactly what we are doing, and if they have questions they can get them in quickly and easily.” Perry also acknowledged some industry concerns about encouraging best practices because that ultimately can lead to regulation. “Incidents lead to regulation,” he pointed out. “And if a broad swath of an industry does not follow best practices, then you can expect to see those best practices become regulations.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It would be nice to see some of the impact fee [collected by the state] going to the studies that are really needed to address the health impact of the hydraulic fracturing process in general.” <span class="attribution">–Trevor Penning</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Rejecting the notion that the federal government should play the dominant role in regulating the fracking industry, Perry stated, “Where you have the potential for pollution to transcend geopolitical boundaries, the federal government has an important role — with the [federal] Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act.” Apart from that, “I would question the wisdom of turning over control to the federal government,” he said. “I’ve been with DEP for over 13 years, under both Democratic and Republican administrations. And we have done more in the past five years than the federal government would have gotten done in two decades.”</p>
<p><strong>Are the Risks Fully Understood?</strong></p>
<p>But do scientists always know enough about the many risks of fracking to make sound judgments about those dangers or uncertainties? “When it comes to health risks, there is a distinct lack” of federal research involving risk assessment, hazard identification, hazard characterization and how to mitigate those risks for humans, according to Penning.</p>
<p>In terms of air quality, Penning said, scientists “know what the hazards might be” in the event that certain levels of contamination are recorded from specific quantities of diesel-driven machinery that are used in fracking, such as compressor stations and trucks taking materials to the site. “We [also] know the components of diesel and what their impact can be if we exceed certain levels,” he noted, adding that scientists also know that there is flaring at the wellheads, and they know how such hazards could affect human health if they exceed certain levels, especially for people with asthma, cardiovascular problems or other ailments. The challenge is to figure out whether those levels have been exceeded. “At least, we have wrapped our head around the issues,” said Penning.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the impact of fracking on water quality, there is a “lack of transparency about the composition of the hydraulic fracturing fluids,” he noted. The fluids used in fracking are a complex mixture, Penning pointed out, and the best way to tackle the challenge is not for toxicologists to study each individual component of the fluids, but to understand how they act together.</p>
<p>“It would be nice to see some of the impact fee [collected by the state] going to the studies that are really needed to address the health impact of the hydraulic fracturing process in general,” Penning added. “And when you consider the number — $400 million [collected] — that is a large sum of money. A small fraction of that could actually go into research to answer the questions [about the health risks of fracking].”</p>

						<p>In his State of the Union address last February, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $9 an hour. “Even with the tax relief we’ve put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line,” he said. “That’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Over the summer, Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, introduced the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013 that would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and automatically index it to the cost of living. In an opinion piece for Politico, Harkin said raising the minimum wage is “good for workers, good for businesses and good for our economy.”</p>
<p>Last week, New Jersey became the 20th state to establish a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum as voters there overwhelmingly approved a ballot question that raised the hourly rate to $8.25. The measure also amends the state Constitution to tie future increases to inflation. New Jersey’s new law has broad public support. In addition, earlier this fall, the California legislature approved an increase in the minimum wage from $8 an hour to $10 an hour by 2016.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>According to a poll taken earlier this year by the Pew Research Center, Americans are in favor of increasing the minimum wage from its current level by a wide margin (71% to 26%).</p>
<p>But the economics of low-wage jobs are complex, and resistance within Congress and the business community to raising the minimum wage is strong. The difficulty is that there is no single, unified economic objective that works for everyone. If you are a low-wage employee, for instance, raising the minimum wage is probably advantageous, as it doesn’t dramatically change the odds that you’re going to get laid off. In addition, you would be making more money. If you are someone who works just above the minimum wage, an increase is also beneficial as it means there may be some upward pressure on your wages. If you are a small business hiring at the minimum wage, however, the costs of having to pay employees more would come out of your pocket. And people who are trying to attain minimum wage jobs could actually be hurt, to the extent that an increase dampens employer demand.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The living wage argument is emotionally powerful. It says that people’s labor should be worth something.”  <span class="attribution">–Matthew Bidwell</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Yet in an era of growing income inequality and at a time when 6.6% of Americans — roughly 20.4 million people — are classified as being in deep poverty (a 4.5% increase since 2000), many view raising the minimum wage as a moral issue. The fact that Congress has acted to raise the minimum wage only three times in the last 30 years shows that “we have become much more tolerant of inequality but also less interested in doing things to help the poor,” says <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/cappelli/" target="_blank">Peter Cappelli</a>, a Wharton management professor.</p>
<p>“There are big costs to society and maybe to [the country’s overall] economic growth of having wages be as stagnant as they are,” adds Cappelli, who is also director of the school’s <a target="_blank" href="http://chr.wharton.upenn.edu/%23id=chr&amp;num=1">Center for Human Resources</a>. “It is no longer just teenagers working at these wages. Many people are trying to live on them, and that also means those people are being supported by the safety net, things like food stamps paid by taxpayers. It’s not a great thing for society to have lots of people working and not being able to afford to live.”</p>
<p><strong>‘A Livable Wage’</strong></p>
<p>One of the most powerful arguments for raising the minimum wage is the notion of creating a “livable wage” that enables people to have the dignity of working a job that pays enough to live on and support their family. Today a person working full-time for the entire year on minimum wage earns roughly $15,000, which puts them below the poverty line for a two-person household.</p>
<p>Raising the minimum wage purely as a poverty reduction strategy is not as straightforward as it seems, however, observers note. For one, most working-age people who live in poverty don’t have a job, and so consequently they would not benefit from such an increase. Second, many people who earn the minimum wage live in households above the poverty threshold, including high school students earning extra pocket money, retirees supplementing their Social Security and others working part-time to add to their family’s income.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>“But there are lots of people who are stuck in those jobs for a long time,” says Wharton management professor <a target="_blank" href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/1385/">Matthew Bidwell</a>.</p>
<p>Data indicate that more than half of minimum-wage workers are in families earning less than $40,000 a year. “So when we’re talking about the minimum wage as a ‘livable wage,’ the question is: livable for who?” Bidwell asks. “For a student or a young person starting out with no dependents, perhaps yes. For a family of four, it’s clearly not. [For the latter group, this is] a public policy problem.”</p>
<p>Raising the minimum wage reflects a certain set of beliefs, adds Bidwell, who notes that several chiefs of big companies, including Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco, and Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, have gone on record as supporting a raise. “For a large organization, like Starbucks, it gets to how they see their role as an employer and their values about the ways in which employees ought to be treated,” he suggests. “The living wage argument is emotionally powerful. It says that people’s labor should be worth something. If you are working full-time, you should not be in poverty. Our societal values are such that you should earn a decent wage.”</p>
<p>While some claim any increase in minimum wages will be passed along to customers in the form of higher prices on goods, others argue that low-wage employees impose significant costs on taxpayers. To prop up people who are making minimum wage, the government provides social services like food stamps and Medicaid, says Wharton management professor <a target="_blank" href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/1714/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/adamcobb/" target="_blank">Adam Cobb</a>.</p>
<p>“And employers that don’t pay people very much money tend to encourage their workers to take advantage of social services,” Cobb notes. “We live in a world where that seems OK: Walmart can pay its workers below-poverty level wages while encouraging its workers to use social services.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“We need to consider who are the types of people making minimum wage and then create policies that reflect that.”  <span class="attribution">–Adam Cobb</span></p></blockquote>
<p>A study earlier this year from researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, analyzed the total average annual public-benefit expenditures on workers from 2007 to 2011. It found that families of fast-food workers are twice as likely to use public programs. In addition, the study found that the total state and federal cost of providing public assistance to the families of fast-food workers totaled nearly $7 billion per year over that time frame.</p>
<p>“Some people get wrapped up in the idea that the government should not intervene in labor markets. But the government is already there,” says Cobb. “We’re all being forced to take part in the low-wage employment system.”</p>
<p>The living wage argument is all the more compelling in light of the changing profile of average minimum wage workers, observers note. A growing number of Americans are relying on low-wage jobs to make ends meet; indeed, about 60% of the jobs created in this economic recovery are low-wage jobs, according to data from the National Employment Law Project (NELP). And unlike in periods past, it is much more likely for minimum- and low-wage workers to be in their 30s or 40s, have some secondary education, and be an important breadwinner in their family, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows.</p>
<p>The rhetoric that it’s only high school kids who have these kinds of jobs is outdated, says Cobb. “Go to any fast food restaurant or grocery store — who’s working there? It’s not just teenagers; it’s adults. We need to consider who are the types of people making minimum wage and then create policies that reflect that.”</p>
<p><strong>Business Squeeze </strong></p>
<p>The debate over the minimum wage often comes down to one question: How much effect does an increase in the minimum wage have on the employment rate? It is perhaps one of the most studied topics in all of economics. The big concern is that in the face of higher labor costs, businesses will have to either lay people off or hire fewer workers. David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine and William Wascher, a Federal Reserve Board economist, have over the years produced several pieces of influential research on the topic. They argue that increasing the minimum wage reduces the employment rate of low-skill, low-wage workers.</p>
<p>“Any time the state intervenes in the employment market, it’s going to have an effect — and not necessarily a positive one,” notes Brooks Holtom, a management professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “This is particularly true right now when we are seeing persistently high employment among low-skilled workers and among the young. The raise [for] the workers has to come from somewhere, and it’s most likely that we will see it in the form of job losses.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“In terms of poverty reduction policies and incentives to work, it’s tough to beat the earned income tax credit. It’s a better use of the bully pulpit.”  <span class="attribution">–Michael Saltsman</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Holtom adds that in today’s highly competitive retail environment, firms are more likely to lay off workers than to raise prices. “Raising prices is not an option because of the strong consumer preference for low prices,” he notes. “People want their groceries and their fast food faster, cheaper, better. So at the end of the day, [some] of these workers will have a little bit more money in their pocket, but [others] will be out of a job. That’s where the inefficiency comes from.”</p>
<p>Many other studies, though, indicate that minimum-wage increases have only a marginal impact on the employment rate. “The reason is that the raise is never enough to make it ‘bite,’” says Bidwell. “It’s never enough of a burden on employers to force them to throw people out of their jobs.”</p>
<p>In fact, there is some evidence that higher wages improve productivity. Research by Zeynep Ton, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, shows that a number of highly successful retail chains — including Trader Joe’s supermarkets and Costco wholesale clubs — that pay their store employees above-average wages, also have the lowest prices in their industries, stable financial performance and superior customer service compared with their competitors.</p>
<p>“Businesses across the board [can] adjust to higher wages,” says Jack Temple, a policy analyst at NELP. “It lowers their cost of hiring and firing and training. Companies also see reduced inefficiencies in their business models.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is some evidence that increasing a wage rate will lower profitability for firms, particularly small businesses. While proponents of raising the minimum wage often point fingers at big corporations that can ostensibly afford to pay workers more, many low-wage employers are small outfits, notes Michael Saltsman, research director at the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed research group.</p>
<p>“It is easy to focus on McDonald’s or Burger King as the ‘corporation,’ but the majority of those fast food restaurants are owned by franchisees,” Saltsman says, noting that labor costs for a franchisee amount to about 30.5% of sales, and profits typically hover around 5%. “That gives you a sense of why small businesses are concerned by a minimum wage increase — even, say, $10 [an hour] rather than $15. Even if labor costs increase by 25%, that more than eats up all the profit earned by the store.”</p>
<p>As an alternative, Saltsman points to the earned income tax credit. The credit allows a worker with earned income to receive money from the government to supplement his or her wages. The subsidy goes only to poor families, and it could be made more generous, he says. “In terms of poverty reduction policies and incentives to work, it’s tough to beat the earned income tax credit,” notes Saltsman. “It’s a better use of the bully pulpit.”</p>
<p>Job training programs targeted at low-skilled workers represent another important part of the solution, according to Mike Grandinetti, a professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Hult International Business School. “We need to attack the problem rather than the symptom,” says Grandinetti, who is also an angel investor and serial entrepreneur. “We need to provide people with training, mentoring and economic opportunity education,” he adds. “We need to improve their skills so that they’re not losing ground. That’s how you solve the problem. Right now, we’re only nibbling around the edges of this.”</p>

<p>Like other necessities of life, food is subject to the subtle and sometimes inscrutable workings of market forces. Yet food, while a necessity, is also much more: Our experience of it is both sensual and highly symbolic, a rich crossroads of history, culture, family and memory. And even as, in much of the developed world, the daily struggle for food has faded into the background, with overconsumption rather than underconsumption the more pressing concern, food remains a contentious issue. Writers like Michael Pollan have raised questions about the influence of large agribusiness, and the call to support local, organic, sustainable food production has become the rallying cry for both a “locavore” food movement and a broader cultural stance critiquing our very way of life.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen’s new book, <em>An Economist Gets Lunch: New Rules for Everyday Foodies,</em> brings a set of simple economic principles to the everyday choices made by people who care about food. It presents a clear-eyed picture of how to go about finding good food value (both in terms of quality and price), one that dispels simple comparisons between local, artisanal traditions and the mass production methods of contemporary consumer society. The book is at its best when, in keeping with its title, it sticks with a highly personal, anecdotal approach.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><strong>Every Meal Counts</strong></p>
<p>Cowen is a foodie, albeit a very particular kind of foodie. While he doesn’t mind spending money on good food, he eschews various forms of food snobbery, especially those that equate cost with quality and automatically assume the superiority of food made from local ingredients. He feels there is no excuse for a bad meal, and believes that the best food values are usually found off the well-beaten path. Excessive routine and excessive regulation are both culinary culprits in his view. Essentially, he stakes out a position as a populist foodie with conservative leanings.</p>
<p>An anecdote in the opening chapter about the author’s search for a few good meals in Nicaragua sets the tone for the best of what is to follow — a kind of personal journey through food, informed equally by economics and informed hunches. While Nicaragua is not known for having great food, the author pays attention to local patterns, gets advice from cab drivers and finds his way to a handful of cheap but satisfying meals. From this experience he distills his central “rules” for common-sense foodies:</p>
<p>1. <em>Every meal counts</em>. Good, affordable food can be found anywhere; it’s just a matter of deciphering local “codes” and “signals.”</p>
<p>2. <em>Good food is often cheap food</em>. This is not to be confused with junk food.</p>
<p>3. <em>Be innovative as a consumer</em>. Cowen believes that a fundamental shift in eating habits starts with individual consumers, not with political or food elites, and that such a shift can make the world a better place. The author asserts that readers can best innovate as consumers by applying basic principles of supply and demand to their daily food choices: “Try to figure out where the supplies are fresh, the suppliers are creative, and the demanders are informed.”</p>
<p><strong>In Defense of Agribusiness … Sort of</strong></p>
<p>One of the author’s central ideological tenets is that large agribusiness is not the villain it has been portrayed to be by authors such as Pollan (<em>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</em>) and Eric Schlosser (<em>Fast Food Nation</em>). Such critics tend to blame agribusiness for the prevalence of highly processed and packaged food in the American diet — everything from Velveeta and Hostess Twinkies to McDonald’s and TV dinners. Cowen contends that contemporary agribusiness is a neutral platform not necessarily biased toward inferior products. Just as we don’t blame the modern printing press for the existence of bad novels, we shouldn’t blame agribusiness for the low points of the American culinary scene.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Cowen does acknowledge that American cuisine went through an extended period of mediocrity and blandness, but presents an alternative history of how this came to be. The first culprit was Prohibition — the 18<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the Constitution outlawing the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages. There has long been a synergy in the restaurant business between food and drink, and the sudden disruption of that equation had a disastrous effect on many of the nation’s best restaurants. Chefs trained in classical French cuisine could no longer even use wine in their sauces. One commentator characterized Prohibition as a “gastronomic holocaust.” Though the period of formal Prohibition lasted only a decade, individual counties and states had been going dry since the 1880s, and many states were slow to restore pre-Prohibition access to alcohol: Texas, for example, didn’t allow the sale of alcohol in restaurants until 1971. Thus, Prohibition has cast a longer shadow over the American food scene than many realize.</p>
<p>Other historical factors include World War II — which placed a premium on convenient, pre-packaged food, often of low quality — and severe restrictions on immigration imposed in the early 1920s and not fully relaxed until 1965. Demographic shifts in the 1950s, like the rise in suburban commuting and in dual-income households, only further reinforced the trend toward a “least common denominator” cuisine in which quickness and convenience trumped quality. Finally, the author notes cultural considerations such as the prevalence of TV and the child-centered nature of American family life. In traditional European culture, children are expected to adapt to adult tastes; the more permissive American approach to childrearing in a sense encouraged the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>Rules for Eating Out</strong></p>
<p>American food has rebounded from its mid-20<sup>th</sup>-century doldrums in a big way, and nowhere is this more evident than in a thriving (if uneven) restaurant scene. There, the author finds considerable cause for optimism in the ongoing American genius for innovating, and for assimilating and combining new influences. Yet just as, in the absence of consumer demand for something better, the American system of food supply and production once tilted toward the mediocre and the predictable, that same system continues to have built-in strengths and weaknesses. The informed consumer needs to understand what the American system does well and to look for telltale signs of innovation and value.</p>
<p>The strength of the American system, according to the author, is in its long and efficient supply lines. While fresh raw ingredients (particularly produce and seafood) are not always easy to find or are available only at a premium, the American system takes “sufficiently good” raw ingredients and combines them in interesting and innovative ways. Thus (with numerous local exceptions, of course) the consumer in search of value is advised to seek out dishes that are <em>composition-intensive</em> as opposed to <em>ingredients-intensive</em>. “Grilled sardines on bread are amazing in Portugal — and pretty cheap — but in Peoria, you should look for something else.”</p>
<p>Armed with this general caveat, the adventurous eater can employ a number of other simple economic principles to the search for good restaurant value. Synergy with other businesses can be bad in the case of hospital cafeterias, but positive in the case of casinos, where house restaurants (particularly those behind the gaming floor) are essentially cross-subsidized by the main source of income, gambling. Labor is a major source of restaurant cost, so extra value can be found in family-run ethnic establishments. Most of all, restaurants with a built-in supply of ready customers simply have less incentive to innovate and provide real value, so, in general, avoid city centers and popular tourist areas, and pick alleys and narrow streets as opposed to broad and well-traveled avenues. Similarly, avoid well-traveled routes within an individual menu: A popular-sounding dish is likely to be below the restaurant’s standards, whereas an unusual or even unappealing-sounding dish is likely to surprise.</p>
<p>Cowen is a big fan of seeking out restaurants in low-rent areas, particularly those with access to high-rent customers. In economic terms, low-rent venues have the freedom to be innovative at relatively low risk. Conversely, high-rent venues such as shopping mall restaurants require a large, steady stream of customers, which usually means more predictable and mainstream food, and less risk-taking. Seek out rundown strip malls, urban fringes and food trucks, the author advises.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the Informed, Committed Customer</strong></p>
<p>The author saves his most original piece of advice for the very end of his chapter on eating out: “Quality customers are often more important for a restaurant than is a quality chef.” Though he doesn’t initially elaborate on this point, the principle comes into sharper focus in a later chapter on the Asian dining scene in America that is one of the highlights of the book. Because Asian countries hold a disproportionate amount of the world’s population and because food is such an integral part of Asian culture, much of the world’s cuisine is Asian or Asian-influenced. That pattern holds true in the United States, and an examination of how simple economics dictates quality and innovation in the Asian dining market is instructive.</p>
<p>The chapter’s most revealing contrast is between Indian and Pakistani restaurants. The two nations were unified for most of their long history, up until a divisive and bitter partition along largely religious lines in 1947. The two cuisines share a great deal of common ground and many common core dishes. Yet the two cultures carry very different associations in the American market. India is billed as the world’s largest democracy and is linked in the American mind with “safe” images, like Gandhi. Predominantly Muslim Pakistan, on the other hand, is a battleground in the war against terrorism and calls to mind images of Osama Bin Laden and the gruesome execution of journalist Daniel Pearl.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the adventurous American diner? While there are certainly many fine Indian restaurants, the perception of Indian cuisine as safe and accessible means that many popular Indian restaurants will cast a wide net appealing to a broad, mainstream audience — often resulting in less distinctive food. By contrast, the more mixed perception of Pakistani culture effectively filters out “uncommitted” customers seeking a safe, predictable dining experience. The largely Pakistani clientele that remains is more informed and committed, a plus for the diner seeking value and quality and innovation.</p>
<p>A small but important measure of how the two dining experiences differ concerns bread. Mainstream American customers expect bread to be served soon after being seated, and this has therefore become the norm at most Indian restaurants. Pakistani customers expect the bread to be made to order, and don’t mind the extra wait. In general, Cowen argues, any factor that might deter the uncommitted mainstream diner — such as explicitly religious décor, the absence of alcohol or difficult-to-read menus — is good news for those seeking an authentic, distinctive meal. Specialization is also usually a good sign. If you’re set on going Indian, pick a restaurant that focuses on a particular regional cuisine.</p>
<p><strong>Barbeque: America’s Original Slow Food</strong></p>
<p>Another highlight of the book is a long chapter on barbeque, which has roots in a number of different cultures but has since become a local tradition in several regions of the United States. The economic indicators of value and quality in barbeque play out in ways that reinforce a number of the author’s previous points.</p>
<p>Cowen opens the chapter with a survey of the range of barbeque techniques — from the historic open pit to the classic brick pit to the more modern mechanized pit — as well as the myriad regional variations in America, which often revolve around differences in sauces and sides. All this history makes for interesting reading, but the heart of the chapter is how barbeque illustrates the author’s earlier distinction between <em>ingredients-intensive</em> and <em>composition-intensive</em> cuisine. Barbeque is a highly regional tradition, yet one that is not particularly tied to fresh local ingredients. Even the meat needn’t necessarily be high quality — indeed, the long cooking methods and rich sauces are, in some cases, a way of adapting to tougher or inferior cuts. Barbeque, the author contends, is a distinctly American hybrid combining regional artisanal techniques with the long, efficient food supply lines that are the strength of American agribusiness.</p>
<p>The sauces that often distinguish regional variations are a perfect example of this hybrid quality. They are composed of the kind of humble, mass-produced ingredients that in some circles give the American system a bad name: mustard, ketchup, vinegar, dried spices. Yet these same sauces are assembled artisanally in small batches that are difficult to replicate or market on a national level. They are local, and yet not local.</p>
<p>Barbeque also exhibits some of the self-selecting dynamics Cowen notes elsewhere. While he seems to have a preference for the classic fire pit over modern gas pits, to some extent the point isn’t one of fire or gas, but the “selection effects” of the older, more artisanal approach. A classic pit restaurant requires skilled labor (including a pit operator willing to work long overnight hours), and will be more likely to have an on-site proprietor — all of which bodes well for overall quality. The artisanal approach also necessarily attracts a different kind of customer in a different kind of setting. The slow methods of a classic pit can’t accommodate surges in demand, and thus tend to thrive in rural settings where committed customers are willing to show up early in the morning for the most prized products, and aren’t surprised if the restaurant runs out shortly after noon. Such rural settings have the added benefit of being low in rent and lax in regulation. A later chapter on why Mexican food tastes better in Mexico observes a similar dynamic in which modern food supply networks and rural artisanal traditions come together in a productive synergy.</p>
<p><strong>Green Revolutions</strong></p>
<p>The book is at its best when its ambitions are modest and the author’s approach personal and anecdotal. In later chapters tackling broader questions of food policy, Cowen overreaches and lapses into didactic, oversimplified arguments. As part of his defense of American agribusiness and his critique of what he views as the backward-looking food snobbery of “locavores” (a term closely associated with the work of Pollan and other liberal food activists), the author wades into the dicey waters of the debate around GMO (genetically modified organism) foods, which he characterizes as the key to the next green revolution.</p>
<p>Cowen makes a number of fair points. Innovations in machinery and the introduction of new hybrids and fertilizers produced dramatic gains in crop productivity in the decades after World War II, forestalling predictions of widespread starvation as the world’s population ballooned. Those gains have since fallen off, and the world is in the midst of a new food crunch, one complicated by the diversion of corn for biofuel and by manufacturing gains in the developing world (and thus in lifestyle and diet) that far outstrip agricultural gains. Moreover, restrictive bans on GMO products in Europe have discouraged African farmers, for example, from taking advantage of the productivity gains they might offer. Despite these valid points, however, Cowen’s treatment of this complicated and contentious issue is too cursory to be convincing.</p>
<p>A chapter entitled, “Eating Your Way to a Greener Planet,” overreaches as well. Again, the author raises some valid issues. An unquestioning embrace of local food production ignores the fact that transportation is a relatively small part of food’s total energy cost (according to Cowen, about 14%) and that overall per-unit energy costs may well be higher for small local farmers. “Locavore” activists should be more careful in distinguishing between products that are flown in at high-energy costs versus those that are shipped in at relatively low cost.</p>
<p>Yet the author’s attempts to link shifts in individual consumer behavior and pressing global issues, like malnutrition and the environment, are quickly and poorly drawn. He opens the book with the bold declaration that “American food is in crisis” (a claim never fully developed), and then goes on to assert that “constructing a better eating experience” is the best single step toward feeding the nine billion worldwide facing malnutrition — but he never quite connects the dots. Cowen is at his best when he stays simple and sticks with his own experiences as both a foodie and an economist.</p>

<p>Consumers of news media want the truth — but not always the truth alone: They are looking, to some degree, for news that confirms — or, at least, acknowledges — their beliefs.</p>
<p>Astute advertisers know this, and when the appeal of a product matches the general slant of a news organization’s approach to coverage, companies will advertise in these news outlets in order to target consumers who have political beliefs similar to the news outlets’. </p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>But the very inclusion of advertising in a news organization’s revenue model, whether it supplements or supplants subscription fees, could serve as either a moderating or a reinforcing force on that outlet’s slant, according to Wharton marketing professor <a target="_blank" href="https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/21206/"><span><span><font color="#0400ff">Pinar Yildirim</font></span></span></a>. Yildirim — along with economist Esther Gal-Or and Tansev Geylani of the University of Pittsburgh — examined this issue in a recent paper titled, “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.journals.marketingpower.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.10.0196"><span><font color="#0400ff">The Impact of Advertising on Media Bias</font></span></a>.”</p>
<p>“Given that [readers] are looking for confirmation of their beliefs, it only makes sense for newspapers to take a biased stance, because they are providing a product — a news product — to consumers that is … in line with their [consumers’] expectations,” Yildirim says. “And when [news outlets] can provide a product that’s in line with expectations, they can charge higher prices.</p>
<p>“As a result, in a competitive marketplace, where there are two [newspapers] earning revenue from subscription fees, it makes sense [economically] that they are polarized, and that they provide different products than each other — one appealing to Republicans, the other appealing to Democrats,” Yildirim adds.</p>
<p><strong>The Economics of Bias</strong></p>
<p>The researchers created a game theoretical model to see how competition, revenue from subscriptions vs. advertising and other factors impact bias in a news organization’s coverage.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Considering a hypothetical market with two newspapers resembling major news competition in the U.S., the researchers found that supplementing subscription fees with advertising creates two counteracting effects. First, any slanting of coverage is moderated when newspaper management is aiming to increase readership as a way of attracting more advertisers. In order to reach out to a larger audience, a newspaper may forfeit its conservative or liberal position and try to appeal to everyone in the market regardless of their political opinions. </p>
<p>But when advertisers opt to pick just one news organization with which to do business, the opposite may take place. That’s because newspapers that seek to appeal to moderate readers are also forced to compete more aggressively for both subscribers and advertisers, which in turn compels them to drop prices. To avoid this effect, “newspapers may choose to increase polarization,” the researchers write. “We demonstrate that when the heterogeneity among advertisers in appealing to consumers with different political preferences is significant, the attempt to alleviate price competition dominates.”</p>
<p>The researchers introduced into their model “a product-specific variable that measures the extent to which political preferences play a role in enhancing consumers’ probability of purchase of the product.”</p>
<p>Some products — a toothbrush, for example, or an insurance policy — may not have any correlation with the political opinions of a person. But sales of pickup trucks and hybrid vehicles, for example, have been shown to correlate with consumers’ conservative (in the case of the former) or liberal (in the case of the latter) political opinions, Yildirim notes.</p>
<p>“Bias,” in this case, refers solely to the political sort — the paper does not consider, for instance, the bias that might be inherent when a magazine opts not to cover the known side-effects of cosmetics sold by its most valuable advertiser. Political bias, which the researchers say can be stirred by selective omission, word choice or the varying credibility of primary sources, seems to correspond with more successful advertising campaigns, when the bias of coverage and the appeal of a product are appropriately matched.</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch, then, has found success with his conservative-leaning media empire not because Fox News or <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reflects a more accurate approach to news, but because, as Yildirim says, “He’s just a smart businessman,” and is essentially giving his audience what it is looking for. Some studies, she adds, have suggested the political opinions of media outlets’ owners seem to have an effect on their coverage, but those sources are few. </p>
<p>“And over time … as the [parent companies of news outlets] become public, as more and more [executives] get involved, it’s likely that the [political] position will change,” Yildirim notes. “It’s more important to understand that the reason for political bias is really economic, more than just the owner’s ideas or journalists spreading their ideological views. Businesses don’t survive in that way.”</p>
<p><strong>A Response to Expectations</strong></p>
<p>According to Yildirim, the practical implication of the paper’s findings for businesspeople is to understand a consumer product’s place in political culture and how the push to attract advertisers might impact a news outlet’s political leanings. “If, for example, you are placing an ad for a product that appeals to conservatives versus liberals,” she notes, “knowing whether competing media outlets earn revenue from advertising versus subscription fees can help choose the right outlet to advertise with.” </p>
<p>Advertisers “know very well that the products they are selling are correlated to consumer lifestyles and values, and they choose outlets that match those lifestyles and values,” Yildirim adds.</p>
<p>An advertiser might choose to advertise in a single outlet — a strategy the researchers refer to as single-homing — versus multiple news outlets, or double-homing. “Firms advertising at a single outlet might be targeting a specific consumer group, even if it is a smaller group. It is also less costly,” Yildirim points out. “Advertisers working with multiple outlets will pay a higher cost, but can reach out to a larger audience…. [For example,] the manufacturer of a ‘green’ product may be interested in targeting a small audience of liberals. But the manufacturer of a cell phone may want to target everyone.”</p>
<p> The authors of the paper, seeking simplicity and consistency, use the word “newspaper” as a catch-all for a variety of news media — radio, television and the Internet — and the word “readers” where “audience” might seem appropriate. </p>
<p>For consumers of news, the authors suggest that the slanted coverage about which readers often bicker is, at least in part, evidence of supply meeting demand. “If people had no expectations with regard to confirming their opinions,” Yildirim says, “that would force newspapers to provide news stories that are slant-free. If [accuracy] was the only expectation, news outlets would have no other reason to put a slant on the stories. So this is partially the expectations of news consumers.</p>
<p>“When we are looking for news, we are not only looking for facts. We don’t listen to news completely open-minded,” she continues. “If you hear something that is completely against what you believe in, most [of us] seem to think, ‘Well, that’s not true,’ as opposed to saying, ‘Oh, really? I didn’t know that. Let me change my mind about it.’ We are very stubborn when it comes to our beliefs and our opinions.”</p>
<p>That preference, regardless of a reader’s awareness of it, can shape the bias of a news outlet. “Newspapers are providing news products that consumers want. If consumers want news with bias, we cannot tell newspapers to provide news that is bias-free,” Yildirim notes. “That is not going to make newspapers better off, and it is also not going to make the consumer happy.”</p>
<p>The political bias of a newspaper, as the paper details, shifts based on whether its revenue comes from advertising or subscription. “In fact,” Yildirim says, “we believe that if advertising is the only source of revenue, it could help to mitigate some of the political bias in news media.”</p>

<p>
	On January 12, a Saturday earlier this year, residents of Beijing woke up to air so thick with pollution that pedestrians could barely see a few feet in front of them. Hourly readings of the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) being reported by the United States Embassy ran off the scale, which ends at 500, peaking at 755. The levels of particulates smaller than 2.5 micrometers — fine air particulates that pose the biggest health risk, which are considered safe at readings of around 25 parts per million — reached almost 900. </p>
<p>
	Following the pollution of the past winter, the pressure to clean up China's air has never been so acute. "The government has been left with no choice but to respond and take action," says Wei Huang, an air pollution specialist at Greenpeace in Beijing. The economics of environmental cleanup, however, are unclear. According to experts, a lasting policy would demand a shift in the types of industry that drive the country's economy and involves a potential slowdown in GDP growth. And, while the recipe for cleaner air could cause some industries to suffer, others are expecting a potential windfall with the rollout of new environmental measures.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

	The difficulty in putting a number on the economic costs and benefits of tackling China's air pollution comes from both sides of the issue — the economic losses due to pollution and the cost of cleaning it up. "It's hard to pull out an exact number on the economic loss due to air pollution in China," notes Wei. "[The country] just started to publically publish [pollution] data in 2013 for all the major cities." </p>
<p>
	In a study released last year, Greenpeace pegged the cost of pollution in Beijing at around US$328 million, based on levels measured in 2010. In Shanghai, the cost was even higher, at US$420 million. This estimate, however, is based only on the number of premature deaths due to air pollution. Other costs — such as those related to chronic illness, lost productivity and environmental degradation — were so difficult to measure with existing data that Greenpeace left them out of its metric entirely. In a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study released the same year, researchers looked at labor and healthcare costs in 2005 and concluded that China had lost US$112 billion due to air pollution.</p>
<p>
	Although China has made efforts to calculate the cost of pollution in the past, with a "Green GDP" effort spearheaded by the country's Ministry of Environmental Protection, those numbers were never released. Without them, it is difficult to measure the economic gains and losses of a cleanup. At the moment, China spends US$91 billion a year on environmental protection, or about 1.3% of its GDP. Experts estimate a further investment is needed to really clean things up — anywhere from 2% to 4% of GDP, or up to US$500 billion each year. </p>
<p>
	<strong>The Target Industries</strong></p>
<p>
	Although pollution sources vary regionally, the 2012 Greenpeace report places a majority of the blame for China's air pollution on coal and automobile exhaust fumes. Any plan for a clean-up must take into account energy production and China's expanding population of automobile owners. In a report released by Deutsche Bank in March, experts encouraged an aggressive approach to tackling pollution in the next five years. China needs "big bang measures," wrote Jun Ma, Deutsche Bank's chief economist, in the report. "The public is now demanding immediate and material government actions to improve air quality." </p>
<p>
	Among the suggestions listed in the report was a reduction in average coal consumption growth by half from the years 2013 to 2017, lowering expectations from 4% annual growth to 2%. According to the report, this measure could be complimented with an increase in the annual growth rate of clean energy sources and a deployment of clean coal technologies that could help reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants by up to 70%. </p>
<p>
	In addition, the Deutsche Bank report suggests lowering expectations for future growth in the sales of passenger vehicles and regulations that increase fuel efficiency. At the same time, the report suggests increasing investment in public transportation options such as rail and subway lines. </p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

	The report predicts that this can all be done while maintaining an economic growth rate of 6.8% annually — a slight reduction from China's current projections of a 7.5% growth rate for 2013. While this seems simple enough, it is predicated on China cutting its energy intensity per unit of economic output in half — a move that would enable economic growth to continue while increases in energy use slow. But that would require a shift from energy-intensive manufacturing toward an increase in the high-tech and service industries. This process could lead to significant economic costs. </p>
<p>
	For example, China's steel industry is currently responsible for producing around 46% of the world's steel. Smelting steel is an energy-intensive, highly polluting business. Slimming down the industry would likely lead to factory closures and layoffs. Some experts hope that these costs would be offset by an increase in more environmentally-friendly jobs, such as healthcare or tourism, but the adjustment could still be painful. </p>
<p>
	<strong>Tackling China's Cars</strong></p>
<p>
	China's ongoing efforts to increase the fuel efficiency of new cars are an example of the challenges regulators face in tackling the economic issues inherent in pollution cleanup. At first glance, increasing fuel efficiency is a much easier issue to tackle than overall energy consumption. In fact, many of these programs are paired with economic stimulus, offering money to consumers to trade in their older vehicles for new ones that meet higher fuel-efficiency standards. </p>
<p>
	This is already being done by municipalities and cities throughout China, says David Vance Wagner, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). "China has moved aggressively on implementing new standards for vehicles,"Wagner notes. "Today, a vehicle that is five or 10 years old can emit as much as 40 times more pollution than a new vehicle. [Increasing the number of newer vehicles on the road is] a very efficient way to clean up the air." </p>
<p>
	The exchange–money for old cars–is typically called a "scrappage program" and has been carried out on a national and local level. Nationally, China offered $3,000 for old vehicles from 2009 to 2010 — not enough, according to Wagner, to really incentivize people. Earlier this year, Hong Kong announced that it was dedicating around US$1.3 billion to removing 88,000 older vehicles from city streets, offering subsidies worth about 30% of the value of a new vehicle. Beijing has its own scrappage program aimed at getting rid of half a million older vehicles by the end of 2015. Doing scrappage at a local level, however, is not ideal. "A lot of those vehicles just get transferred to other parts of China,"Wagner points out. "To be really effective you have to have a national program." </p>
<p>
	The challenge to implementing a national program, however, is fuel. Vehicles manufactured to meet more stringent emissions standards require a higher quality of fuel than is typically available at the Chinese pump. Low-quality fuel can ruin certain parts of the engine. Refining high-quality fuel, however, costs money. "Someone," says Wagner, "has to bear that cost." </p>
<p>
	In China, the price of fuel is set by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), while the cost of refining is borne by large state-owned enterprises like PetroChina and Sinopec. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) has jurisdiction only over vehicle standards. And, without the ability to pass the cost of refining higher-quality fuel to customers, the state-owned enterprises have no incentive to improve their fuel. The MEP has spent the last decade trying to negotiate higher fuel quality with the oil companies, the NDRC and China's Ministry of Commerce. </p>
<p>
	In the United States, Wagner notes, fuel standards can be set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Fuel companies can then choose to change their gasoline prices and defer that cost to customers at the pump. </p>
<p>
	But in China, it took the notable January 12 pollution event, which attracted the attention of China's top leaders, to finally reach an agreement on setting standards. "In January 2013, this stalemate was finally ended by an unprecedented high pollution episode occurring in hundreds of major cities throughout the nation," according to an ICCT report on the matter. By the end of February, China's government released a time table, mandating that new fuel quality standards for diesel and gasoline be issued by the end of this year, in order to be implemented by the end of 2014 for the first phase of improvements, and 2017 for a second phase. </p>
<p>
	"Now we are waiting for the standards to come out," says Wagner. </p>
<p>
	The ICCT estimates these fuel improvements will end up increasing the cost of fuel by .10 RMB per liter of gasoline. "They haven't said how they're going to pay for it,"Wagner notes. One possible option is requiring that the NDRC change the price of fuel at the pump, allowing refineries to transfer the cost. "More likely, we'll see a tax adjustment," says Wagner. In this scenario PetroChina and Sinopec would be taxed at a lower rate for higher-quality fuel. </p>
<p>
	"The other big component of this is the actual vehicle standards,"Wagner notes. "They have a few key steps to take and then the fuel quality is going to be there. Then, they can move forward with vehicle standards." This, he adds, would pave the way for a larger scrappage program. "If you're going to scrap a few million vehicles, you wan to make sure they're replaced with the cleanest vehicles possible." </p>
<p>
	<strong>Alternative Energies</strong></p>
<p>
	The resolution to China's fuel quality problems demonstrates the nation's preference for environmental measures that can be combined with economic stimulus or alleviated through tax breaks. There is no other industry so likely to benefit from this strategy as alternative energy. </p>
<p>
	In fact, the pollution of the last few months has already given a boost to China's lagging solar panel manufacturers. By the end of January, China had already announced plans to increase its 2015 targets for solar installation by 67%. In 2012, China's solar companies were suffering from an oversupply of panels and the price of bonds issued by the companies had plummeted. Panel prices were down by 25%. With the increase in pollution, however, more investors are convinced that China's government will continue to keep these companies prosperous. Bond prices have already started to respond. </p>
<p>
	China's commitments to increasing clean energy overall have shifted from a 36-gigawatt increase of installed capacity in 2012 to a 52-gigawatt uptick planned for this year. </p>
<p>
	While the mandated increases in solar capacity are good for domestic industry, growth in other areas is poised to benefit Western companies. "U.S. companies and European companies are quite happy about China moving on standards," says Wagner. "It will be a tougher push for Chinese domestic companies." </p>
<p>
	In a report released by the Pew Charitable Trusts earlier this month, U.S. suppliers of renewable energy and power management products had a US$1.63 billion trade surplus with China in the year 2011, out of a total US$8.5 billion in clean energy goods and services that were exchanged. </p>
<p>
	In addition, China's increasing investment in alternative energy sources is occurring at the same time other nations are drawing back on similar initiatives. While China excels in manufacturing wind turbine blades and solar panels, Western companies lead in the high tech and specialty equipment required to run those energy sources and connect them successfully to an energy grid.</p>
<p>
	While China's increasing commitment to cleanup will boost certain clean energy and environmentally-friendly industries, some experts worry that these measures alone will not be enough to improve air quality. "We hope that there will also be stricter regulations, from approving new coal-fired power plants to information disclosure from factories and punishment to those factories that violate the emission controls,"Wei notes. "It will be very difficult for China to clean up its air."</p>

Wharton marketing professor <a target="_blank" href="https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/193/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/faderp/" target="_blank">Peter Fader</a> explains in this opinion piece. </em></p>
<p>Everybody has been buzzing about Nik Wallenda and his daredevil crossing over Niagara Falls this week. Elsewhere in the world of sports, the USA gymnastics trials for the Olympics will start later this month, and there’s nary a whisper about it. This difference in public interest/attention makes me think about the difference between the fields of economics and marketing: Economics is like a high-wire act, and marketing is equivalent to gymnastics. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Economists are an interesting breed. They have their heads in the clouds, dreaming of a magical world where people are rational, markets operate efficiently and all kinds of other strict rules apply about what’s right and wrong. In their vivid imaginations, they see upward-sloping supply curves, downward-sloping demand curves and all the implications that arise from these and other assumptions. They are not particularly troubled by facts, often because the actual “rubber meets the road” data that would support or refute such assumptions are hard to find — especially when they’re too busy balancing their delicate curves in a manner that often seems to defy the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Occasionally, economists encounter phenomena that don’t seem to comply with their balancing act — much like a gust of wind endangers the tightrope walker. That’s when their real skills start to show. They conjure up new assumptions and clever twists on old ones to prove that seemingly irrational phenomena are, after all, quite rational. Balance is restored once again. Well-written books like <em>Freakonomics</em> beautifully demonstrate this blend of art and science. It is wonderful to behold such mastery, and the skills required to stay safely perched up high are quite considerable.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, marketers – like gymnasts – start and finish with their feet on firm ground. The marketer’s desire is to understand the way the world <em>really</em> works – not how it <em>should</em> work under a shaky set of assumptions. Marketers and gymnasts also emphasize the need for balance, but in their case this word means something different than it does for the high-wire economists. Much of the balance for a marketer/gymnast arises from the need to be quite good at each of several different tasks. For the gymnast, this means achieving excellence across a variety of physical challenges (e.g., floor exercise, vault, parallel bars, etc.); for the marketer, it means mastery across a variety of academic disciplines (such as statistics, psychology, anthropology, sociology and – yes – economics).</p>
<p>Overspecializing in any one of these areas is a path to sure defeat; the key is to develop a broad set of skills to ensure that you can take on all the twists and turns required by the problem at hand, while always landing safely on two feet. A marketer wants to “stick the landing” by offering an implementable solution to a real problem – not an ivory-tower explanation that merely proves that the world is still rational.</p>
<p>Because marketing/gymnastics is so deeply rooted in reality, it is gritty work that doesn’t generate the same “oohs” and “aahs” as a tightrope performance. People look up to economists and down at marketers – just like they do when their athletic counterparts are performing. Economists get to rub elbows with presidents; marketers get to sell more deodorant. Nik Wallenda gets a prime-time special on national TV, and marvelous movies have been made about other high-wire heroes such as Philippe Petit (<em>Man on Wire</em>). In sharp contrast, however, can you name a movie about a famous gymnast? Likewise, it’s easy for business leaders to name many economists, but how many can name even a single marketing professor? (I guess I should give up hope that they’ll make a movie from my new book, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/books/customer-centricity-essentials/">Customer Centricity: Focus on the Right Customers for Strategic Advantage</a></em>).</p>
<p>OK, I admit it. While I’m proud to be a marketer, I do suffer from a bit of econ envy – as do many of my marketing brethren. It’s not that we feel intellectually inferior to our economist cousins; it’s just that we wish we could get some of the glory and attention that seem to come so naturally to them. We respect their work quite a bit (in part because our field derives some of its intellectual origins from theirs), but we hope in vain that they would share some of their limelight with us.</p>
<p>But when I stop being wistful about such matters, and get back to work, it’s all worthwhile. I genuinely enjoy the challenges of describing markets and consumers as they really are – not as they should be. I appreciate the opportunity to learn and combine different skills to solve complex real-world problems. I’m glad that companies come to me when they are looking for tangible recommendations and measurable solutions.</p>
<p>And while I know there will never be a Nobel Prize for marketing, at least I can draw some consolation that gymnasts can compete for Olympic gold, unlike the folks who teeter on the high wire.</p>

						<p>Among several closely watched bellwethers of the incipient economic recovery, one indicator in recent months has quickened the pulse of pundits. The “quit rate” has inched up, setting off a round of optimism. “Workers Shed Caution in a Healthy Sign for Labor Market,” trumpeted <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304450904579369123380120880">a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article</a> earlier this year. “Millions Of People Are Quitting Their Jobs Every Month. That’s Good News,” <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/01/22/263504402/millions-of-people-are-quitting-their-jobs-every-month-thats-good-news">reported NPR reassuringly</a>.</p>
<p>The resurgent quit rate—the percentage of workers leaving jobs voluntarily—may indeed end up being cause for celebration, especially if other economic indicators rise with it. The willingness to quit signals a welcome movement in the job market because it loosens up opportunities and mobility, as well as hints at increased confidence of workers who may be leaving one job before finding another. But the news isn’t all good — nearly a decade of depressed job numbers leaves some experts wondering about what kind of damage has been wrought on career arcs, the psyche of the American worker, and employer-employee relations.</p>
<p>It’s been a long haul, after all. Back in 2006, the quit rate was holding steady around a healthy 2.5% for the private sector. By 2009, it had dipped to 1.4%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and by last year had only recovered to 1.8%. For a while, during the worst of the recession, workers were so fearful about the economy that the number of people quitting dipped below the number being laid off or fired — an inversion of the norm.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>So when the private-industry quit rate rebounded to 2% in April, many cheered. But the Great Recession has been different from previous downturns. It has loosened ties between employers and employees and <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/declining-employee-loyalty-a-casualty-of-the-new-workplace/">eroded loyalty on both sides</a>.</p>
<p>“It used to be that job satisfaction would spike up in recession, but with this recession job satisfaction fell a lot, as did perceptions of commitment,” says management professor <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/cappelli/" target="_blank">Peter Cappelli</a>, director of Wharton’s <a target="_blank" href="http://chr.wharton.upenn.edu/">Center for Human Resources</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.wharton.upenn.edu%2Farticle%2Fwhen-its-time-to-quit-your-job%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknlg.net%2F1w1uxM1&amp;source=tweetbutton&amp;text=Via%20%40whartonknows%3A%20%27I%20don%E2%80%99t%20think%20there%20were%20many%20employers%20who%20even%20pretended%20to%20shield%20employees%20from%20the%20downturn%27" class="fyc_printfriendly tweetthislink" target="_blank">“I don’t think there were very many employers who even pretended to shield their employees from the downturn, so if you think about why employees would stay, it’s not because of loyalty — it’s fear that if you change jobs, something bad is going to happen to you. The fear right now is nobody wants to jump into an organization they think is still restructuring. This is a kind of devil-you-know problem.” <i class="ss-icon ss-social" style="font-size:10pt">Twitter</i> </a></p>
<p>The direction of the quit rate by itself — which has remained flat since April — isn’t particularly meaningful, says Wharton management professor Matthew Bidwell, but combined with other metrics, it helps to indicate whether conditions are improving.</p>
<p>“What tends to drive mobility a lot of the time is when an existing firm grows, or new firms get started. And so where do they get workers from? They pull them out of other firms,” he says. “So when you see a higher quit rate, what you’re seeing is the process of pulling people out of jobs. And the fact that this is not happening is certainly a change in U.S. capitalism. There are different ways to organize the workforce and production, but in a country that always had this entrepreneurial model, this kind of shift looks like a lot less job creation. That alarms people.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t think there were very many employers who even pretended to shield their employees from the downturn, so if you think about why employees would stay, it’s not because of loyalty…”<span class="attribution">–Peter Cappelli</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>An Employers</strong><strong>’ </strong><strong>Market </strong></p>
<p>The other reason to worry is that while the quit rate appears to be recovering, factors apart from job creation itself may be distorting the rate to appear better than it actually is. The federal government has been tracking the quit rate since 2000, but Federal Reserve Board chair Janet Yellen raised the number to a seemingly higher level of significance in 2013 when she said that “a pick-up in the quit rate, which also remains at a low level, would signal that workers perceive that their chances to be rehired are good — in other words that labor demand has strengthened.” More recently, in August, she reiterated her credo: “I take the quit rate in many ways as a sign of the health of the economy.”</p>
<p>This week, the BLS announced in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey that the August 2014 level held steady at 2% for private industry. But the quit rate has not yet recovered to 2006 levels, much less the peaks reached during the boom years. And at least some of the reason it has risen may take the wind out of the sails of optimists. Quit rates vary by sector, and much of the job growth in this recovery has been in lower-paying jobs like retail and food service, where turnover is generally higher anyway. Additionally, the introduction of the Affordable Care Act has likely emboldened some to work part-time or leave the work force altogether, which could result in a somewhat higher quit rate.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Bidwell points out that one of the benefits of moving from job to job in the past was the promise of more money. But wage growth has stalled. “It used to be you could start in a low-skill job, then move into a mid-skill job, but now it’s much harder to move into a higher-skill job,” he notes. “The decline of manufacturing didn’t help. There is a surprising amount of evidence that the growth of China as an exporter has had a more damaging effect on the labor market than anyone thought. All the trends point to widening inequality. The labor market is not in a happy place.”</p>
<p>For employers, on the other hand, a depressed quit rate has been beneficial, says Bidwell. “Hiring is expensive, turnover tends to be disruptive, and if workers don’t feel like they have many options, it strengthens employers’bargaining power,” he notes. “I think there tend to be a lot of people who think that with fresh blood you might get rid of the people you want to lose, but most studies have not found that. A low quit rate is good for employers. It does still look pretty much like an employers’ labor market.”</p>
<p>The average worker is feeling the lack of prospects. Even as unemployment rates have fallen this year, a May Pew Research Center/<em>USA Today</em> survey of 1,501 American adults found a disconnect between brightening statistics and conditions as workers are actually experiencing them. Only 27% of those surveyed said they believed jobs to be “plentiful.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It used to be you could start in a low-skill job, then move into a mid-skill job, but now it’s much harder to move into a higher-skill job.”<span class="attribution">–Matthew Bidwell</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Looking at quit rates and other data, economics professors Steven J. Davis of the University of Chicago and John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland have found that U.S. labor markets have become much less fluid —and that rates illustrating this point have been falling for decades, and cut across geographic, demographic and industry-sector lines.</p>
<p>The erosion, they argue in “Labor Market Fluidity and Economic Performance,” has been harmful to productivity, wages and employment. “If our assessment of how labor market fluidity affects employment is approximately correct, then the U.S. economy faced serious impediments to high employment rates well before the Great Recession,” they write. “Moreover, if our assessment is correct, the United States is unlikely to return to sustained high employment rates without restoring labor market fluidity.”</p>
<p><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure5.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95726" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure5.png" alt="Quitting-figure5" width="642" height="485" srcset="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure5.png 642w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure5-300x226.png 300w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure5-560x423.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"></a></p>
<p>Bidwell sums up the point the country has reached this way: “We are in a recovery. It’s not a great recovery. It’s hard to know what’s going to make it a great recovery. I think a lot of it is pretty depressing.”</p>
<p><strong>Biding Their Time</strong></p>
<p>“I think people maybe feel stuck where they are, and almost out of necessity are staying in a job as opposed to taking the risk of moving to something else, since there isn’t much payoff for doing that,” says the Economic Policy Institute’s Valerie R. Wilson, director of the Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy. “There is still a lot of slack in the labor market overall … and so there is still a lot of downward pressure on wages, and the quit rate won’t have the potential for growth until there is an increase in wages.”</p>
<p>But for workers who feel stuck, now is exactly the time to be looking for a new job, according to Pamela Skillings, author of <em>Escape from Corporate America: A Practical Guide to Creating the Career of Your Dreams</em> and president of career consulting firm Skillful Communications.</p>
<p>“I think some people are in a situation where they are staying in an environment they are afraid of leaving, and people are saying ‘I should be grateful for what I have,’” she notes. “At the same time, people are working harder than ever because a lot of places are understaffed. Even if you are willing to take a risk with something new, finding the time to look for a new job while working crazy hours is very difficult.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“People are working harder than ever because a lot of places are understaffed, so even if you are willing to take a risk with something new, finding that time to find an opportunity while working crazy hours is very difficult.”<span class="attribution">–Pamela Skillings</span></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s easier said than done, Skillings admits, but it’s important to make the time to move on “if you say to yourself on a regular basis, ‘I wish I could quit, I hate this job.’ Then I think it’s important to take some time — your lunch hour or half hour — to take some steps toward assessing the situation in your industry and asking whether it is as bleak as some would have you believe. Are there opportunities out there?”</p>
<p>The sustained period of a depressed quit rate has shaken the confidence of some, says Skillings. “If you are going on an interview and come [across] as negative, it may sound corny but it’s all about practice…. It’s about writing a script and saying, ‘Here are what my message points are,’ like a politician or someone going on the <em>Today</em> show, so you can feel natural and convey what you want to convey.”</p>
<p><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure6.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95727" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure6.png" alt="Quitting-figure6" width="623" height="485" srcset="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure6.png 623w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure6-300x233.png 300w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Quitting-figure6-560x435.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"></a></p>
<p>Some of Skillings’ clients are content in their jobs, but she also senses “a lot of frustration”on the part of workers unhappy with their jobs — and it’s an unhappiness that may be waiting for a chance to express itself. “I do think that people are, from what I’ve seen, biding their time,” she notes. “A lot of companies have taken the focus away from employee retention and making people feel challenged and other things that can make for a great place to work. Anything that is not essential, that is where the budget gets cut. That attitude takes a toll in people feeling that they are being taken exploited.”</p>
<p>How does someone know that it’s time to leave a job — despite the risks? “There is a piece of research about marriage that says when you get to the point in a relationship and you see contempt in the expression on the other person’s face, even if it’s in the early stage, it’s a predictor for divorce,” says <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/monicam2/" target="_blank">Monica McGrath</a>, Wharton’s vice dean for the Aresty Institute of Executive Education. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.wharton.upenn.edu%2Farticle%2Fwhen-its-time-to-quit-your-job%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknlg.net%2F1w1uxM1&amp;source=tweetbutton&amp;text=When%20is%20it%20time%20to%20quit%20your%20job%3F%20%27I%20would%20say%20contempt%20is%20a%20pretty%20good%20standard.%27%20Via%20%40whartonknows%3A" class="fyc_printfriendly tweetthislink" target="_blank">“I would say that’s a pretty good standard — contempt, certainly high levels of stress, feeling incompetent in an organizational structure.” <i class="ss-icon ss-social" style="font-size:10pt">Twitter</i> </a></p>
<p>She adds that many organizations aren’t putting a lot of effort into “acknowledging people who are doing a great job. If you need that and are not getting it, and you have this distrust of the organization, all that has a negative effect on your whole person. I don’t know how someone would get up in the morning and go to work.”</p>
<p>It’s important, McGrath notes, for deeply unhappy workers to not wait until they reach the slam-the-door-and-walk-out stage. “That happens to people; they leave before they manage to find another job or before they’ve figured out how to map a job strategy,” she says. Cappelli adds that it’s never a good idea to leave a job before landing another one. “The market shows distaste for unemployed people looking for jobs,” he notes.</p>
<p>McGrath does not sense a lot of pent-up frustration from workers that can be traced to this recession in particular. “I don’t see it. I was hearing it 10 years ago, I heard it 20 years ago. Some people just get to that edge and it’s time to move on,” she notes. “I don’t believe in asking the question, ‘Is it fun anymore?’ But you can ask, ‘Am I being satisfied intellectually, am I feeling challenged in some way, and am I learning?’And if the answer is yes and you don’t have contempt, it may not be time to quit.”</p>

<p><em>“Why would a man in Morocco who doesn’t have enough to eat buy a television? Why is it hard for children in poor areas to learn, even when they attend school? Why do the poorest people in the Indian state of Maharashtra spend seven percent of their food budget on sugar?” Such are the questions that MIT economists Abhijeet Banerjee and Esther Duflo seek to investigate in their research, according to the website of their book, </em>Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty<em>. </em></p>
<p><em>What makes Banerjee’s and Duflo’s approach radical? The reason is that, unlike other economists who focus on macro issues such as aid, they approach poverty much as medical researchers might set about finding the treatment for a disease — by conducting clinical trials. Duflo, who <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/esther_duflo_social_experiments_to_fight_poverty.html">delivered a TED talk</a><em> on this theme in February 2010, explained that the effects of aid are often hard to measure, but it is “possible to know which development efforts help and which hurt — by testing solutions with randomized trials.” Their method involves putting social initiatives to the same rigorous scientific tests that medical researchers use for drugs. This takes the guesswork out of policy-making, according to Duflo, by showing “what works, what doesn’t work and why.” There are no miracle cures, but specific steps — such as providing food as an incentive for immunization or providing subsidized bed nets to reduce malaria — can end up having a massive impact on efforts to reduce poverty, the authors note.</em></em></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><em>Banerjee and Duflo never expected </em>Poor Economics<em> to make for good business. “We wonder how our book is a business book,” says Duflo. But the attention their book has received has now been capped by the 2011 </em>Financial Times<em> Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award. Banerjee and Duflo were at a conference in Goa, India, last week. After their presentation, the authors sat down with Knowledge@Wharton to explain their concepts and how they can be used to end global poverty. </em></p>
<p><em>An edited version of the transcript follows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How does it feel to win the book award?</p>
<p><strong>Esther Duflo:</strong> We are certainly happy but at the same time baffled. We wonder how our book [can be considered] a business book since it is about finding and thinking of ways to end global poverty. Nonetheless, we are happy that some businesses and businessmen are interested in our work.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What, in your view, is the best way to tackle poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Abhijeet Banerjee:</strong> The central point of our book is that there isn’t a single answer, that the question itself is wrong. There is no single action that is going to solve the problem of poverty. There are perhaps a few hundred steps that we need to take, each of which will do something, as long as we take the right steps. There is no evidence that we could adopt one step that is far more important than the others. I think that the one-size-fits-all recipe for tackling poverty is an illusion. It is a convenient illusion, so that you can believe that you can solve the problem with a single step. But this does not seem to be supported by data.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> But surely of those hundreds of steps, there must be some crucial ones that come to mind when you talk of eliminating poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> Yes, there are some crucial steps. I can’t say they are the most important but these, as we know today, are very effective. However, that is not to say that in the future there will not be other steps which would be even more effective.</p>
<p>According to our current state of knowledge, there is a zone of shadow where we are not sure exactly what to do. But there are some things we do know that work across sectors. Educating children, for example, is one of them — imparting quality education to them right from a young age. Similarly, there could be positive social and political impact of health care for the poor, which includes steps like better access to preventive health [and] finding ways to put iron, vitamins, etc., in the food that poor people consume, which we know will be good from a medical point of view. Giving an asset — like a cow — to extremely poor people, and then some help in taking care of that asset, also works. These, we feel, are some of the effective steps that can be taken in the initiative towards ending poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>In your presentation at the Goa conference, you emphasized the quality of education, quality of curriculum, etc. In the case of the poor, where educating children is often seen as the only passport to escape poverty, does the quality of education matter?</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> Yes, that is absolutely crucial. If you don’t learn to read or acquire basic math skills by the time you are 13 or 14 — and there is a significant portion of students with this deficiency — then the entire effort is worthless. It is a crime that children should be subjected to such education. No one is talking to them, the whole class is going on and they do not understand a thing. There is nothing worse than this. I don’t believe we are giving children a decent chance to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> [While] it is not good to say that no education is better than some education, an education that is so blatantly ignorant and irrelevant is a torture.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How do you define poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> There is no one way to define poverty that is going to satisfy everyone. You have to make an arbitrary call as to what you think poverty is, and when you make that call, you should decide what you are trying to capture. If you are trying to capture a set of people who are so desperate that they need immediate help, that is one thing. If you want to say what is an unacceptable level of standard of living, and the country needs to somehow fix that problem, then that is a different thing. There is no definition that is independent of the question you have posed. If the policy question is, ‘How do I target emergency help?’, then that is one definition. It would be very different if you were to decide to set the target for, say, the next 15 years. Our poverty line for the desperately poor should be much lower than our goal that you will provide everyone at least ‘X’ after 15 years. It depends upon what policy question we are trying to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In India, poverty has always been a top-of-mind issue. Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize for his work on poverty. C.K. Prahalad became famous for <em>The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid</em>. Would you agree that poverty in India is a lucrative opportunity area?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> At a basic level, there are lots of poor people, and so they are a market. There are some forms of social businesses that have done well in this regard, and they are there for us to see. A lot of people inspired by C.K. Prahalad say that you can make money while helping the poor. However, you have to be a little more careful. I am not saying that these opportunities don’t exist. Sometimes it is true that there is a market and someone can come and creatively tap it. But there are also lots of things that the poor need and the market is not able to provide them. It is a big mistake to think that markets will be able to do everything. This notion is misguided.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: The Indian Planning Commission has set the poverty line at 65 cents a day. You have different views on this and on what parameters poverty should be measured. Would you briefly explain that?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> Let’s not use [the conversion to U.S. cents]; it is very misleading. Let’s say Rs. 32, and let’s be very clear about what that means. The problem with that conversion is that it doesn’t allow for differences in prices. The latest conversion between the rupee and dollar that allows for differences in prices is roughly Rs. 19 to a U.S. dollar. That is the right conversion, not Rs. 48 or Rs. 49 to a dollar [the current exchange rate]. This is what the World Bank uses in PPP [Purchasing Power Parity] estimates. So, under this conversion, Rs. 32 is $1.70. That’s the right number, not 65 cents a day. For any of these questions [about poverty], the market dollar rate is not relevant. You take a bus ride here, it costs Rs. 3. In the U.S., it would cost $2. You have to adjust for the fact that things are cheaper in India than in the U.S. If you don’t do that, you get a completely misleading number.</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> We are not deeply interested in measuring poverty. Others do it. People in the World Bank do it, and they put in lots of effort at measuring poverty levels. India itself has a long tradition of doing that very well. At the end of the day, what is important is not to measure poverty as much as try to understand what to do about it. In some sense, it is a democratic debate in which all people should have something to say.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> The poor, you say, are more discerning customers than the rich because they have to make a little go a much longer way. But do the government, aid workers, companies, etc., make any effort to provide choice?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> It’s a good question. I think lots of aid policy and, in general, the social policy ignores the free will of the poor. They are seen as sort of desperate — you give them this and they are going to take it. The poor, on the other hand, are trying to have a good life within the constraints they face. And if you tell them to have a particular kind of food every day just because it is healthy food — for instance, eat chickpeas everyday — they are not going to do it. So you have to dig out their reality as to how they want to live their lives. We often tell them to boil water for 20 minutes but we don’t take the reality of their lives [into consideration]. Twenty minutes is a lot of time for a woman who has to do so many things in the house. You have to think of what the priorities are. You tell them to do things and then wonder why they are not doing them. They are not doing them because you have not understood their lives very well. You have to give them choices and understand their choice behavior. If you really want to do something for them, you have to make it attractive enough for them to do it. You can’t think of the poor as machines.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Is the problem of global poverty too huge to envision and address?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> We need to cut this huge problem into many problems, problems that can be dealt with one by one. Some people term it as one huge problem and then conclude that there is one big solution to it. Projected this way, people get depressed by the enormity of the problem. The right thing is to say that it is not one giant problem, but a series of issues that need to be addressed in numerous ways. This way, there will be incremental victories and progress towards ending poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You say that the three villains of efforts to eradicate poverty are ideology, ignorance and inertia. And the three problem interfaces are the expert, the aid worker and the local policy maker. In rural India, it is the local government and the aid worker who are regarded as the biggest hurdles. What is your experience of other countries?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> Essentially, there is not much aid coming to India, and hence you cannot blame the aid workers. India gets very little aid, and most of the money on anti-poverty programs is spent by the government. So, there is no large presence of aid workers in India, but there are many good NGOs [non-governmental organizations] in India who are doing excellent work. There is a lot of difference between the places where policies are being designed, say in New Delhi, and people in the field. These field workers are doing good work, and they have a much better sense of what is actually going on at the field level. Their knowledge is not necessarily being harnessed. There are countries — in Africa, for example — which receive lots of aid, but essentially face the same issues.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Do anti-poverty campaigns receive enough money? Is there adequate funding for projects such as yours?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> No. There is a lot more money that could be spent. And even within what is being spent, little money goes into supporting innovative programs that can be carefully tested, carefully identified and carefully implemented. Too much money and governmental resources are spent on programs that have not been tested. Rather than spending it carefully, too much is spent on [the] wrong programs. There is too little money going into anti-poverty programs that we would like to see.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What has your Poverty Action Lab (the Abdul Latif Jamil Poverty Action Lab or J-PAL) accomplished so far?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> In 2003, we founded the Poverty Action Lab to encourage and support research on a new way of doing economics, based on what we call randomized control trials. These give researchers, working with local partners, a chance to implement large-scale experiments designed to test their theories. As of 2010, J-PAL researchers had completed or were engaged in 240 experiments across 40 countries. A very large number of organizations, researchers and policy makers have embraced the idea of randomized trials. Many have come to share our basic premise — it is possible to make very significant progress against the biggest problems in the world through a set of small steps, each well thought-out, carefully tested and judiciously implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How do you think the Occupy protest movement, that started on Wall Street and has spread globally, will impact the ongoing debate on global poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> At the moment, the Occupy Wall Street protest is very much in response to domestic issues in the U.S., to the increasing inequalities in the U.S. in the past 10 to 15 years, to inertia and to the inadequate response to the economic crisis in the U.S. Global poverty is not at the forefront of their consideration at this point in time. So I frankly don’t know whether or not this protest is going to have any impact on how to think about solving the problem of global poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> There is a general worry that it will lead to an irresponsible, populist backlash in policymaking in the West, like anti-trade and all that. It could turn into something like the Tea Party. And that will be bad. But right now, they are just reacting to what is the real problem in all the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries. In some of these countries, there is ballooning inequality, and there is very little official response to tackle this.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Recent studies have shown that poverty has increased dramatically in the U.S. over the past decade, due in part to the economic downturn. In a world of continuing global financial uncertainty, what challenges do we face in fighting global poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> Slowing growth in the West is a huge problem for growing countries like India, China, Bangladesh and Pakistan, which rely on servicing these markets. They are all going to face some constraints on that account. It is also clear that there is a certain amount of policy attention or creativity that is now being directed to finding the equilibrium within [Western] economies. After all, we need talent from the whole world to think about ways of ending poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> The crises in the end have to affect the lives of the very poor. The immediate impact of the global financial crisis was not as harsh on the very poor as on the middle classes of the rich countries. What is more worrisome is the inability to get out of the crisis in the past few years. That eventually will create additional challenges, particularly for the people in the developing world.</p>

						<p>Starting sometime in the 1980s, cryptic messages began to appear embedded in the roadways of cities across the U.S. and South America. Linoleum tiles, most roughly the size of a U.S. automobile license plate, were fused into the asphalt, carved with some variation of the message:</p>
<p>TOYNBEE IDEA<br>
IN MOVIE 2001<br>
RESURRECT DEAD<br>
ON PLANET JUPITER</p>
<p>Although the largest number of the tiles appeared in Philadelphia, nearly identical tiles have been spotted in U.S. cities from Washington, D.C., to Boston and as far west as Kansas City, Mo., as well as in the South American cities of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
<p>When a friend first told filmmaker Jon Foy about the tiles in 1999, he thought the person was playing a joke on him — until he saw a tile for himself. The mysterious markers might have remained a mere curiosity for Foy had he not encountered Justin Duerr when a prank phone message intended for a friend of Foy’s was inadvertently picked up by Duerr — who thought it was a message for him from the mysterious tiler. When Foy spoke to Duerr to apologize for the confusion, he learned about Duerr’s obsession with the tiles — and knew he had to make a movie about the search to uncover the identity of the tiler.</p>
<p>It took several years to get the film off the ground. In 2005, Foy left school at the University of Texas at Austin to return to Philadelphia to work on the project. Largely self-funding his efforts while working as a house cleaner and a participant in pharmaceutical research studies, Foy followed Duerr and fellow investigators Colin Smith and Steve Weinik for five years on their quest to uncover who was behind the tiles and why.</p>
<p>Last fall, Foy submitted a rough cut of his film, <em>Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles</em>, to the Sundance Film Festival. He walked away with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sundance.org/festival/blog-entry/2011-festival-awards/">Directing Award</a> in the U.S. Documentary Competition.</p>
<p>Knowledge@Wharton recently sat down with Foy to discuss the tiles, his quest to make a documentary about the investigation to uncover their origin, and the economics of independent filmmaking. <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2833">To read the full interview, click here</a>.

<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">When powerful forces collide head-on at the intersection of politics and economics, the crash is bound to be loud and unsettling.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Consider the current rift between the United States and China over China’s currency, the yuan. The Bush administration is publicly pressuring China to allow the yuan to rise against the dollar to stave off protectionist legislation in the U.S. Senate. Some lawmakers, responding to concerns on the part of manufacturers and labor unions, assert that cheap Chinese exports — made even cheaper by a yuan whose exchange rate, they say, is too low in relation to the dollar — give Chinese firms unfair advantage over American companies and is a major contributor to the U.S. trade deficit and current-account deficit. In response, Chinese officials, who have kept the yuan fixed at 8.28 to the dollar since 1994, have said firmly that they will not be coerced into taking action by a foreign government seeking to meddle in a matter of national sovereignty.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Faculty members at Wharton and other China-watchers predict that China will eventually revalue the yuan, probably this year, because it is in China’s own long-term interest to do so. But the United States, by trying to force the issue in such a vociferous, public manner, is unnecessarily antagonizing the Chinese and possibly delaying the revaluation, according to these experts. They say that the application of pressure by the United States is a political move designed to assuage interests adversely affected by competition from China. They add that revaluing the yuan will not revitalize industries that have been battered by a longstanding and irreversible trend of certain jobs moving to China, where labor and production costs are cheap.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">“The Chinese are very proud and they are most likely to revalue when we don’t expect it,” says finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~marstonr/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/marstonr/" target="_blank">Richard Marston</a>, director of the Weiss Center for International Financial Research at Wharton. “I think they will do something this year, and it will be modest. The more pressure we put on them, the more they are going to balk.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeremysiegel.com/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a> says the U.S. pressure on China simply is “not right,” adding that countries should be left alone to decide what exchange rates they want to set.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and a longtime foreign exchange and commodities trader, calls the U.S. move “completely politically driven” and “economic nonsense.” He adds: “I think [U.S. officials] are playing to the special-interest crowd. There’s no question about that.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Richard Moody, vice president and senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group, in Pittsburgh echoes these views, calling “extraordinary” the amount of pressure the United States is applying to China. “It really is a sovereign decision of the Chinese government as to where they set their currency,” he says. “And the pressure they’re coming under is complicating the process. It’s helping to drive a lot of speculative money into China, with people hoping to make a quick gain on any revaluation of the currency. It’s potentially very destabilizing for the Chinese economy.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">China has kept the yuan pegged to the dollar in order to encourage exports, which have contributed so much to its stunning economic growth in recent years, and to keep a damper on inflation. Determining how much the yuan should be allowed to appreciate against the greenback is tricky business for Beijing: A rising yuan would make China’s goods more expensive overseas, curtailing sales and reducing economic growth.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Marston says China essentially has two options: Allow the yuan to appreciate against the dollar or peg the yuan’s value against a basket of currencies — the dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen. But whatever action they decide to take, Chinese officials should make a bold enough move to avert calls for another revaluation. They are, however, unlikely to be sufficiently bold. “Once they take any action, it will be seen as not enough and it will encourage further speculation,” Marston notes. “I’d tell them to choose an exchange rate high enough so as to reduce the pressure for further changes. Piecemeal attempts would require additional changes in the future and increase pressure. They should repeg the yuan against the dollar or, preferably, against a market basket.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">“What we need to ask is, ‘What can the Chinese do to respond to the pressure without making major changes?’ Marston continues. “They could just announce a modest appreciation and then repeg the yuan at 5% more or less than that. That clearly will relieve some of the pressure but could lead to further calls for additional moves.”</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">A Basket of Currencies</span></b></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Marston says the components of a currency basket, and the weight accorded each currency, would reflect the relative importance of the countries that are major trading partners with China. The advantage of a basket is that if there were a movement by the euro against the dollar, for example, China could adjust to that movement. If the euro were to rise against the dollar, it would force an appreciation of the yuan against the dollar and a depreciation of the yuan against the euro.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Noting that the European Union also has begun to put pressure on the Chinese regarding the yuan — in a dispute centered on Chinese textile exports to Europe — Marston says America should ease up on China. “With the Europeans joining us now, we ought to sit back and wait for the Chinese to respond. We ought to use a little less rhetoric and a little less action in the Senate and try to use backdoor diplomacy.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: verdana;">Finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/herring.html">Richard J. Herring</a>, director of Wharton’s Joseph H. Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies, believes that China will ultimately move to a currency-basket peg, probably without explicitly identifying the weights attached to each currency and probably with a modest appreciation relative to the dollar. “They will probably also adopt a band around that peg within which the exchange rate will be allowed to fluctuate,” Herring notes. “That will put China’s exchange rate policy in line with most of the other countries in Asia. Currently only three, including China, peg to the dollar. The timing, of course, is anyone’s guess, but U.S. policy seems decidedly counterproductive in this regard.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: verdana;">When China makes the shift, “it will be, quite properly, to meet China’s own best interests, not to satisfy either the Americans or the Europeans,” adds Herring. “The problem for China is that its capacity to ‘sterilize’, or offset, the impact of purchases of dollars with yuan is constrained by the underdevelopment of Chinese capital markets and the implicit limits on placements of bonds with Chinese banks. This is, indeed, the reason that most countries that have undervalued exchange rates ultimately adjust.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Wharton’s Siegel says China will “eventually” revalue the yuan but is uncertain when that might be. “I don’t think they want to revalue but I think they will for political reasons. Something like 10% is a possibility.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Moody of PNC expects that China will allow the yuan to float within a band of plus or minus 10% against either the dollar or a basket. He says such a modest move will probably leave the United States unsatisfied, but that it will be sufficient for the Chinese for the time being. “There are reasons to suggest why it would be in China’s interest to have a more flexible currency,” he explains. “It would give them more control over monetary policy. By pegging the yuan to the dollar, they are implicitly following the monetary policy of the [U.S.] Federal Reserve. If China’s economy continues to grow and inflation becomes a concern, it’s in their interest to be in control of their own currency. Today, inflation is relatively tame, but over time it could become a concern.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">The Wharton faculty members and Moody all say that China will not, and should not, allow the yuan to float freely against the dollar at this time. “It’s not realistic for China at this point to go to a freely floating currency,” Moody argues. “The dynamics of their economy are not consistent with that.” In a report titled “China Outlook,” Moody writes that China lacks “the types of efficient and transparent capital markets and financial institutions that are a necessary ingredient of a system with free flows of capital – into and out of a country – and a market-determined exchange rate.”</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">“I tend to think they are not going to go to a float,” says Siegel. “Years into the future that might work. But right now they will just do a revaluation to get the Americans off their backs.” Adds Marston: “There’s no possibility at all that China will go to a floating exchange rate. The notion they are suddenly going to adopt a free-market philosophy for their currency is crazy.”</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">An Old Story</span></b></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Complaints that China has been “manipulating” its currency to the disadvantage of the United States have risen periodically in recent years. The lower the yuan against the dollar, the cheaper Chinese products are for Americans to purchase and the more expensive U.S. goods are for people in China to buy. Many in the United States point to China’s large trade surplus with the United States as evidence that the yuan is unfairly undervalued. The U.S. trade deficit with China stood at $162 billion in 2004. The total U.S. current-account deficit — the combined balances on trade, income and other transfers with all countries — was $665.9 billion in 2004, up $135.3 billion from 2003, according to preliminary figures compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">But Herring says American officials are mistaken to think that revaluing the yuan is the answer to the huge U.S. current-account deficit. “<span style="color: black;">Although hectoring China about the exchange value of the yuan seems to be the centerpiece of U.S. policy for dealing with the current-account deficit, it should be remembered that even a very large appreciation of the yuan would have only a modest impact on the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar. China’s share of U.S. imports is about 10%, so even a 20% appreciation of the yuan — which is much larger than most experts anticipate — would have at best a 2% impact on the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar.  The answer to our current-account deficit lies not in Beijing, but in Washington, D.C.”</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">What got the latest controversy started was legislation introduced by U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, to impose a 27.5% tariff on imports from China as a response to the so-called currency “manipulation.” The Senate is expected to vote on the bill this summer.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">According to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow told reporters on May 17 that “in the absence of reforms, I’m very concerned there will be mounting protectionist pressure in the United States. That’s something we need to avoid.” Those comments came the same day that the Treasury Department issued a report to Congress on international and exchange-rate policies. The report stopped short of officially calling China a country that “manipulates” its currency to get a leg up on international competitors, but it nonetheless strongly urged China to allow the yuan to appreciate.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">In a formal statement accompanying the report, Snow said China’s current rigid currency regime has become highly distortionary. Among other things, he said, the current yuan-dollar exchange rate “poses risks to the health of the Chinese economy, such as sowing the seeds for excess liquidity creation, asset price inflation, large speculative capital flows, and over-investment. It also poses risks to its neighbors, since their ability to follow more independent and anti-inflationary monetary policies is constrained by competitiveness considerations relative to China. A more flexible system will also support economic stability, which we understand is of paramount importance to the Chinese leadership.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Snow stressed that the United States is not calling for “an immediate free float with fully liberalized capital markets,” explaining that China is not prepared for such a major shift. What the United States wants, according to Snow, is “an intermediate step that reflects underlying market conditions and allows for a smooth transition — when appropriate — to a full float.”</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">The Threat to China’s Economy</span></b></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Hanke of Johns Hopkins finds Snow’s comments unconvincing. “Snow has contradicted himself several times. He says ‘[China] is ready to have a flexible system, but we don’t want them to have a free float.’ He doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Hanke, who was an adviser to the Indonesian government during the 1998 Asian currency crisis, says a major revaluation of the yuan would devastate China’s economy. He says a 25% revaluation, for instance, would bring on “a complete economic slump. The negative ripple effects would be unbelievable and quite destabilizing in China. … You already have such a mountain of non-performing loans in China, and that would become catastrophic. Also, the real-estate boom or bubble along the coast would completely collapse and the banking system would implode.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">In addition, says Wharton management professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/meyer.html">Marshall Meyer</a>, “Chinese agriculture is very inefficient, and farmers are heavily subsidized. Revaluation will lower the prices of imported foodstuffs, with grievous consequences for farmers’ income and possibly political stability. The numbers are striking: 62% of China’s population is rural. That means that farmers’ cash income comes from the 40% of food sold on the market. About 10% of this 40% is already imported. If the 10% goes to 20%, farmers lose a third of their cash income.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Meanwhile, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington on May 26, Snow predicted that China would revalue the yuan, also known as the renminbi, by mid-October, when the Treasury Department is scheduled to release its next report on currency manipulation, according to news reports. A day later, Chinese officials reiterated their position that they would take a cautious approach to economic reforms, Reuters reported. Zhang Yansheng of China’s National Development and Reform Commission said much work was still needed in such areas as currency, taxation and foreign-trade policy to minimize the impact of yuan reform on China’s economy, according to Reuters. “It will be better to keep the renminbi’s exchange rate stable for another two years,” Zhang told the <i>International Business Daily</i>, a newspaper published by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Reuters reported.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">U.S. officials may complain about China’s foreign-exchange policy but Marston says it should also be kept in mind that China is a major purchaser of U.S. Treasury securities, which helps to keep the U.S. current account deficit from being worse than it is. And having the Chinese revalue the yuan will not make a major dent in reducing that deficit.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Says Marston: “The current-account deficit is at records levels. It’s a very serious problem. The deficit, which stems from low savings rates in the U.S., has to be financed by capital inflows from abroad. To make inroads on lowering that deficit, you can change the exchange rate between the dollar and other currencies. But I think the deficit is far too large for currency changes have a major effect. The U.S. savings rate is only 1% of GDP [gross domestic product], an all-time low. Unless we do something about savings in this country, we’re not going to have a major change in the current-account deficit. Some say, ‘If we could only get China to revalue its currency, our deficit would disappear.’ No economist believes that.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Beijing’s Global Forum</span></b></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">The views of the Wharton faculty on the yuan were echoed by economists and others who attended the Fortune Global Forum in Beijing on May 17. During an afternoon session on the global impact of dollar depreciation, Stephen Roach, chief global economist of Morgan Stanley, called “pure politics” the criticism from U.S. lobbying groups that the fixed yuan exchange rate has caused the country’s huge trade deficit. “What worries me most is that the value of the yuan becomes too correlated to the value of the dollar. The U.S. is China’s biggest export market. Any adjustment the U.S. makes to its current account will affect China’s exports, sending ripple effects” throughout the country, Roach said, adding that the Schumer bill introduced into the U.S. Senate in April is “an upsetting measure.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Stuart Gulliver, chief executive, corporate, investment banking and markets, HSBC, said China’s trade surplus is largely due to its cheap labor. Trade with China accounted for only 10% of total U.S. trade, he noted, adding that in order for the U.S. to solve its deficit problem, it should control excessive consumption in addition to pushing for dollar depreciation.” As for when China should move to reform its fixed rate currency system, the country should do so when it “feels that the time is right.” In terms of which direction the reform should go, he said, “obviously that falls within China’s sovereignty.” If the yuan were to appreciate too early, he added, that would only introduce more speculative capital to the market.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Li Jiange, vice director of the development research center of the State Council, noted that senior Chinese government officials have said repeatedly that China’s currency reform should be carried out according to the country’s needs, taking into account the potential impact on China’s financial systems, trade and manufacturing. Kevin Watts, chairman of Merrill Lynch International, suggested that the yuan exchange rate is not the top economic challenge facing the world, and its importance is being exaggerated.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">As many experts attending the discussion pointed out, political pressure — not economic factors — is pushing the U.S. to demand yuan appreciation. Most agreed that any drastic yuan appreciation would not only be disastrous to China but also bad news to American consumers who have grown used to cheap made-in-China goods and products.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">During a session at the Forum on “Understanding China’s Capital Markets,” Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People’s Bank of China, noted that “If we reform the exchange-rate system in a way that will improve foreign and domestic investors’ confidence, such reform benefits the capital markets.” Zhou also said that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s speech earlier made it clear that the government will not carry out currency reform in a hurry. No timetable was offered.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange on May 10 issued rules capping short-term borrowing offshore at $34.8 billion for foreign banks and $24.5 billion for Chinese banks. The move was aimed at releasing pressure on the yuan caused by growing capital inflows. On May 18, China expanded its foreign exchange trading system in an effort to help develop China’s interbank foreign exchange market and release speculative pressure on the yuan.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">On May 20, China said it is raising duties on 74 textile products starting June 1. The new tariffs will curb China’s textile exports to the U.S. and Europe. China’s garment exports have surged since a global quota system was scrapped at the end of 2004. Among the 74 items are seven kinds of clothing imports that the U.S. targeted for new trade quotas.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Then on May 30, China announced that it was rescinding its planned tariff increases on Chinese-made textiles exported to the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">The View from Chinese Economists</span></b></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Peng Xinyun, a currency expert at the Institute of Bank and Finance, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told reporters that it’s not the best time for yuan appreciation. To recapitalize state-owned banks, China recently injected a total of $60 billion of its foreign exchange reserves into the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. If the yuan were to appreciate, the capital level at those banks would come down, dealing a blow to the government’s efforts to recapitalize them. “China won’t allow yuan appreciation until the commercial banks have adequate access to capital,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">According to Yi Xianrong, a researcher at the Institute of Bank and Finance, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the benefits to the U.S. from the yuan’s peg to the dollar actually outweigh the negatives. Furthermore, now is not the right time for yuan appreciation. Agricultural exports are not a big concern, he said, noting that China’s agricultural products can compete in the global markets and will become even more competitive once further technological progress is made.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Lin Yifu, director of the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University, expressed the following views while talking to Sino.com visitors about economic issues: </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">“The large fiscal deficit and low savings rate are the main causes for the huge U.S. trade deficit. Appreciation of the yuan won’t help the U.S. with its trade deficit at all, because most of China’s exports to the U.S. are labor-intensive products that are not produced in the U.S. If the yuan were to appreciate, the U.S. would have two choices: It could continue to buy those products from China, but it would have to pay more, further enlarging the deficit; or it could buy those products from other countries that also have cheap labor. The reason that the U.S. hasn’t bought those products from other countries is because they are relatively more expensive than China’s. That’s why yuan appreciation won’t help the U.S.” He also noted that the Chinese government still has a number of fiscal responsibilities, such as recapitalizing state-owned banks burdened by bad loans and supporting the social security system. </span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Ba Shusong, vice director of the Finance Research Center at the State Council’s Development Research center, suggested that “American politicians seem to believe that yuan appreciation could narrow the country’s current-account deficit.” Instead, he said, the U.S. government “should choose the following measures: tightening its economic policies, including narrowing its fiscal deficit, and raising interest rates to curb consumption while encouraging saving. It is a process full of economic and political adjustments, and there could be substantial political obstacles. That’s why American politicians prefer pushing for dollar depreciation over making internal economic adjustments.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">The U.S. “also hopes that other currencies’ appreciation could release pressure on the dollar,” he added. “It’s the fundamental reason that the U.S. is actively pushing for yuan appreciation … But even a substantial yuan appreciation would have only a very limited role in helping the U.S. improve its trade situation…. In fact, given the economic interdependence between China and the U.S., any substantial import tariff measures adopted by the U.S. unilaterally wouldn’t be efficient and would harm the U.S. economy in the longer term.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Huang Zemin, an expert on exchange rates and dean of the business school at East China Normal University, told Chinese reporters that “at present, China should focus its exchange-rate reform on the foreign-currency administration system. Due to China’s economic reliance on trade, balance of payments should be the main factor for judging whether the yuan exchange rate is reasonable. Our exchange rate has been balanced in the past three years…. The trade imbalance between China and the U.S. is not because of the yuan exchange rate, but because of the two countries’ different trade structures.”</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">U.S., European Protectionism</span></b></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Salvador Rojí, professor of multinational financial management at the Complutense University of Madrid, predicts that China will “ultimately wind up revaluing its currency because of pressure from other countries, especially the United States.” The revaluation process will be gradual, he says, to avoid any breakdown in economic stability.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">As for the politically sensitive area of textile exports, China is already restricting its exports through increases in its export taxes — an action that is “something quite different from placing direct limits on the volume of exports,” adds Rojí. “Whether they do that will depend on regional trade agreements between China and Europe, which include other products and services traded bilaterally.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">Asked if it is hypocritical of the U.S. and the EU to place limits on free trade now that it is causing problems for U.S. and European textile manufacturers, he notes that “historically, there have been many occasions when the U.S. and Europe have not hidden their protectionist feelings about third parties. In the West, the halo of liberalism doesn’t cover everyone, and very few countries fully embrace free trade. Generally, it is only small countries that do, like Singapore and Holland, which have minimal domestic markets and need to open themselves to the outside. Given the semi-protectionist history of both the U.S. and EU, we cannot talk about ‘hypocrisy.’ It’s simply that they are defending their social and political interests. And they do not hide that fact.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana;">In looking at whether each country should have the right to control its own currency, Rojí suggests that sovereign states can utilize their exchange rate as a tool to compensate for any increase in their inflation rate that cuts their [global] competitiveness, as well as for providing benefits to specific economic groups, such as exporters. However, when governments give up that power, as in the case of the euro zone members, governments can only carry out fiscal policies, improve efficiency and productivity, and set wage limits. They cannot make use of the devaluation safety valve.</span></p>

						<p>French economics professor Jean Tirole of the University of Toulouse won the 2014 Nobel Prize in economics this week for his work on the thorny issue of government regulation of monopolies and oligopolies (when there are a few large players with a lot of market power), the threats they pose to consumers, and policies for curbing abuses.</p>
<p>“This year’s prize in economic sciences is about taming powerful firms,” noted Staffan Normark, the permanent secretary for the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that awarded the prize.</p>
<p>Many reports point out that Tirole’s work avoided the traps of simplicity that had limited the effectiveness of most other research in this area. The Academy press release noted that most other models apply a single solution across industries, “such as capping prices for monopolists and prohibiting cooperation between competitors.” Yet, price caps can motivate firms to reduce costs – a good thing – but also allow for “excessive profits – a bad thing for society.” Another dilemma: “The merger of a firm and its supplier may encourage innovation but may also distort competition.”</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>Tirole in his research bypassed these inherent contradictions. He showed that corporate competition rules can work well when they are tailored to an individual industry’s unique traits rather than being applied in a standard way across all industries.</p>
<p>According to Wharton management professor <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/guillen/" target="_blank">Mauro Guillen</a>, Tirole has had a “huge impact theoretically and also in terms of policymaking. Antitrust authorities have used his pricing model for oligopolistic goods and services when it comes to formulating regulation, especially in the telecommunications industry.” He adds that <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.wharton.upenn.edu%2Farticle%2Fnobel-prize-winner-jean-tirole-the-giant-tamer%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknlg.net%2F1rv5xIK&amp;source=tweetbutton&amp;text=Nobel%20Prize%20winner%20Tirole%20%27has%20shown%20that%20markets%20often%20fail%20to%20perform%20well%2C%20contrary%20to%20the%20Chicago%20view.%27" class="fyc_printfriendly tweetthislink" target="_blank">Tirole also “has shown that markets often ‘fail’ to perform well, contrary to the Chicago view <i class="ss-icon ss-social" style="font-size:10pt">Twitter</i> </a>, and that government regulation is needed to help them allocate resources in efficient ways that benefit the consumer.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Tirole has had a “huge impact theoretically and also in terms of policymaking.” <span class="attribution">–Mauro Guillen</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Several sources note that Tirole’s career has involved many landmark studies over a vast breadth of important topics. But the Nobel Prize focused on just a few areas of his work, including monopoly and oligopoly regulation, game theory, contract theory and industrial organization.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Esther Gal-Or, professor of marketing and business economics at the University of Pittsburgh, notes that Tirole’s research on monopolies is especially relevant now because “regulation is a hot topic…. We are living in a world where we have monopolies … that are revolutionizing processes and bringing products in that are changing the entire model, [like] Google and Apple. They have acquired significant market power … and they are attracting a lot of attention [by regulators].” (Gal-Or offered her thoughts about Tirole’s work on the Knowledge@Wharton show <a target="_blank" href="http://businessradio.wharton.upenn.edu/">on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111</a>. Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)</p>
<p>“The Nobel committee rewards academics for a specific contribution, but the cited work is rarely [their] sole contribution,” says <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/pyild/" target="_blank">Pinar Yildirim</a>, a Wharton marketing professor. “And if you ask others, sometimes the cited work may not even be the most influential. There are no Nobel laureates who have had a single contribution followed up by low productivity. Most of these scholars have a lifetime achievement and inspire the work of others.”</p>
<p><strong>A Huge Body of Work</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/9NKhT50nBLMYKcA3mehmIJ/Mint-View--A-prize-for-Jean-Tirole.html">Mint</a>, a business daily in India, also points out that the Academy chose to make the award based on a relatively narrow sliver of Tirole’s body of work. “Tirole is much more than that: He belongs among a handful of economists who have written phenomenal papers in almost all reaches of microeconomics and formal political economy.”</p>
<p>Says Yildirim: “There are very few comparable economists who may have written about as wide a variety of subjects. From regulation to platform economics, two-sided markets, political economy to behavioral topics such as self-control, beliefs and irrationality, he [has written] on … subjects in a way that reached a large audience in and out of economics. And he — along with his co-authors — was often the first economist to take interest in these subjects.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Nobel committee rewards academics for a specific contribution, but the cited work is rarely [their] sole contribution.” <span class="attribution">–Pinar Yildirim</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Yildirim adds that “Tirole is an economic theorist; he almost never touches data or empirical work. Many other theorists like him have been awarded the Nobel prize. In my opinion, you can be equally influential whether you use only the tool of analytical modeling or add data to it.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Academy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2014/advanced-economicsciences2014.pdf">noted</a> that Tirole’s work has “facilitated realism,” while the work of many other economists presumes that markets are perfectly competitive. Tirole’s models deal with the world of business as it is practiced every day — where sorting out a motive for actions gets messy. His work offers guidelines on how to get things done in the real world. The Academy further pointed out that “Tirole’s models have sharpened policy analysis. Focusing on the fundamental features that generate a divergence between private and public interests, Tirole has managed to characterize the optimal regulation of specific industries.”</p>
<p>In one example of the practical implications of Tirole’s research, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/13/jean-tirole-won-the-2014-nobel-prize-in-economics-for-actually-showing-us-how-the-real-world-works/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> cited the defense industry as an oligopoly where it is difficult for the government to distinguish fair pricing from gouging. That’s because the typical defense company has all of the production or service information – a one-sided affair academics call the problem of asymmetric information. In practice, the government and the defense contractor will agree on a contract price, but cost overruns are extremely common, and the government typically has little choice but to pay additional amounts because there are so few service providers to choose from.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Post</em>, “Tirole showed that, sometimes, the government can do better if it offers companies a choice of contracts. This forces firms, at least indirectly, to reveal whether they have high or low costs, since different contracts will be better for them depending on that.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in his home country, “a very limited number of people knew of Jean Tirole,” says Stephane Marchand, chief editor of <em>Paris Tech Review</em>. “Contrary to many big-shot economists, he is very shy and had limited exposure in the media. Tirole’s research has been very important in shaping anti-trust regulation in Brussels. He was more influential on the European stage than in France. He has been advocating that labor markets in France are in a catastrophic stage of decay – we have the highest rate of unemployment for young people and for seniors aged above 50. It is ironic that one of Tirole’s specialties is industrial economics – how to organize your industry so that it offers a strong defense against attacks from abroad. During the past 30 years, France has lost close to 30% of its industrial production — with huge consequences for jobs.”</p>

<p><em>Over the past decade, the music industry was roundly criticized for how it responded to the proliferation of digital content — <span>launching hundreds of lawsuits against otherwise law-abiding consumers who downloaded music. Although many companies have backed off from that approach, the challenge remains to find a business model for digital music. If songs can be downloaded and traded for free, how do the musicians, recording engineers and record company executives get paid? </span></em></p>
<p><em>Jim Griffin, working as an advisor to Warner Music Group, has a plan to find an answer. </em></p><div class="active friend-module-target">
    <aside class="friend-module">

<p><em>At the recent </em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.supernova2009.com/"><em>Supernova</em></a><em> conference in San Francisco, Griffin — who spoke on a panel titled, “Is There a Media Business?” — characterized the music industry’s conundrum as “Tarzan economics”: “We cling to this vine that keeps us off the jungle floor. Yet, at the same time, we swing for the next vine, because we want to be propelled forward. The trick is figuring out when to let go of that old vine and when to embrace that new vine.” Griffin points out that the problem is particularly pronounced for those for whom the “old vine” is still profitable and who have a “responsibility to continue to book that revenue.” </em></p>
<p><em>Griffin, however, is looking for the next “vine” by working with the music industry to explore new revenue models for the digital world. Starting this year, he is partnering with a number of universities to experiment with business models that allow students to download and share music, while finding a way to remunerate the artists who create that music. </em></p>
<p><em>The initiative, dubbed “Choruss,” was started by Warner Music Group and seeks to become an industry-wide consortium of artists and recording companies whose goal is to develop a system of “collective monetization,” a means of generating revenues in a way that acknowledges the current state of affairs where music is easily traded online. </em></p>
<p><em>Knowledge@Wharton spoke with Griffin following his panel presentation to learn more about Choruss and how it might change the way music is distributed and monetized. An edited version of that conversation follows. </em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What is your role at Warner Music Group, and how is it related to Choruss?</p>
<p><strong>Jim Griffin:</strong> Warner owns Choruss; it incubated Choruss. Choruss is now becoming an independent company with Warner still involved. [Warner Music Group CEO] Edgar Bronfman saw the wisdom of a shift from product to service, and [thought]: “Yes, I will incubate that here at the company. You can start with our content and then seek to bring others in.” </p>
<p>We are looking at a transition from product to service, where that service requires a kind of aggregation that has occurred in the past in the music business. In some ways it predates the music business itself. It started in 1847 in Paris — at the Ambassadors [<em>Les Ambassadeurs</em>] restaurant on the Champs-Élysées. A famous composer, [Earnest] Bourget, went to dinner and heard his music being played by the orchestra. He left without paying for his meal because he said, “They’re not paying me for the music I wrote, so why should I pay them for the food that they gave me?” </p>
<p>He goes to court and the judge says, “You have to pay for the meal, but they have to pay you for the music, too. But good luck getting paid. What do you want? Do you want every restaurant, every place that needs your music to contact you? How are you going to get paid in this new world?” </p>
<p>At that same time and place, Victor Hugo and Henri de Balzac had a law passed that said that you couldn’t read their books aloud in public without paying them. They had this mutual interest: How do we get paid in a world where our works are distributed widely — [in a] restaurant or a hotel lobby or whatever? They formed the first collective for musicians and writers, what became known as SACEM [<em>Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique</em>]. </p>
<p>The concept spread out of France to Canada to the French-speaking territories and then to the United States in the form of ASCAP [American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers], BMI [Broadcast Music, Inc.], and SESAC [originally, Society of European Stage Authors and Composers, although its current focus is broader]. It is a notion that we call “collective monetization” or “collective licensing.” And it has played a key role in the monetization of music over hundreds of years.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Given all this history, why are we in such dire straits now? Why haven’t we worked this out?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin</strong><strong>:</strong> Humorous, isn’t it? It’s because what intervened was a <em>product</em> business in music — the idea that you could put music on a piece of plastic or a piece of vinyl. The service promoted the product, and everybody was happy. </p>
<p>Now we are beginning to realize that music — the product — exists only for a blip in time. It’s not [now] the dominant way that we get music. And yet it was how we monetized music for quite a time. </p>
<p>Now we get back to the notion that music is a service, not necessarily a product. And its financial value can be measured as the quantity and the quality of the crowd it draws. That leads us back to the idea of: How then do we collectively monetize music? </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How is Choruss going to provide a solution to this?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin</strong><strong>:</strong> Choruss is that very notion of a collective monetization society — much like that first one, SASEM. Music’s mindshare has never been higher. It’s not a buggy whip situation — it’s not like we don’t need it anymore. Music is present in almost every place we go. It still has an enormous value in keeping people in a restaurant ordering more drinks and getting more food, keeping them aggregated in hotel lobbies, drawing them to cable channels and websites. </p>
<p>[Music] is more relevant than it has ever been. Its mindshare has never been higher. But its <em>market</em> share has never been lower. That is a result of a transition I call Tarzan economics, a clinging to this vine of product but knowing that <em>service</em> really is the value. How do we fully realize the service value where there is, by its very nature, an aggregation occurring? </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You mentioned BMI and ASCAP, which are organizations that handle royalties for the publishing rights of music for songwriters. </p>
<p><strong>Griffin</strong><strong>:</strong> Yes. ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC only collect for the performance of music, not its recording.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Should we think about Choruss as an attempt to provide a similar model for recorded music?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin</strong><strong>:</strong> Very much so. You should see it as sound recording companies learning to act more like music publishers — realizing that the financial value may not be fully represented in a manufacturing operation that controls the quantity and destiny of music, but instead in the economic value that music brings to any activity. </p>
<p>It is an interesting conundrum that today, if a sound recording plays on the radio, in a hotel lobby or in a restaurant in the United States, the songwriter gets compensated, but the sound recording owner does not. Yet without that sound recording there is nothing to pay the songwriter for. </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> The examples you have chosen — of music played in a hotel lobby or a restaurant — are, in a sense, easy ones. The greater concern is about music downloaded over Limewire or BitTorrent. Are you hoping to cover that as well through this model?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Yes, that is precisely our goal: To evolve, over a period of time, a model that works for performance and extend that to what were traditionally products on the ‘Net.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What might this look like? Can you make this a little more concrete?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Sure. In fact, we are working on those very experiments right now. There are a half a dozen schools that are conducting Choruss-related experiments that seek to uncover the degree to which this model can be extended to the downloading of music. </p>
<p>They are experimenting with different approaches. But let’s take the prime example — peered sharing of music — because we know that music fans love to share music. Here we take peer-to-peer sharing of music and we put a flat fee price with unlimited access. We take those flat fees and we put them into a pool and then divide those pools based upon metrics that are derived from the use on the network. [The metrics] might be: how often a song is acquired or how often a song is played. No one is sure. This is an art, not a science.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How would you know how often the song is played?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> You could [survey] a representative group. Or you could ask them if they would agree to be monitored for a time — <em>à la</em> Nielsen or Arbitron — the same way we do it for radio or television. While it’s imperfect, it is a metric that works. It is good enough for commerce. We have a very robust advertising economy that moves on what people say they watch or listen to. It’s good enough. We bring that same approach to the downloading and the sharing of music in some of our experiments.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Do the experiments that are underway at the universities include only Warner content? </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> No. We’ve asked all artists to participate. The other record companies are participating — and publishers and songwriters as well.</p>
<p>The idea is to test the notion that you can pay for music as a service and that money can be pooled and divvied up in much the same that we do with cable [TV], for example. </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> One can see how this might work in a university where, like your cable TV example, there is some control over the distribution network. But in the case of the global peer-to-peer networks, you don’t control the distribution point. </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> But you needn’t. There is no control necessary under this model. All one needs is the payment of a fee and some metric for its delivery to continue to incent the creation of content.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How does the payment of a fee happen? Who pays?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> In this case it is a voluntary decision that an individual makes: Do I wish to participate in this system? They are then given an account and a password to trade all of the music they want, knowing that the activity is legitimate, that they have paid a fee for doing so, and that the fee will be allocated to those who own the rights for that content.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> This would be opt-in? </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Sure. Like cable. You get to decide: Do you want to subscribe to HBO? And when you do, the same thing that happens — your money goes into a pool that is used to pay for rights.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Yet, in the case of music downloading, there is an embedded culture of free music sharing. </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Sure — because there is no legitimate alternative. In other words, the point is: Can we get at the motive for piracy without worrying about its mechanism? </p>
<p>Traditionally the way of dealing with piracy has been to attack the mechanism. Here, there is an acknowledgement that technology not only has made it voluntary to pay for music, but that every year it is going to be more voluntary. If we reach that understanding — that, as a technical matter, it is voluntary to pay — then our question becomes: How can we deal with the motive for piracy? </p>
<p>There I think the response is a business response. It is not the law. It is not technology. Traditionally our approaches have been law and technology and they have proven to be clumsy and blunt tools indeed. </p>
<p>The point is: Can we make a business deal with an end user that makes it more attractive to pay? Can we give them a better service than piracy can give them? Can it be faster? Can the files be better quality? Is there a price that you are willing to pay for that? We are experimenting with that very question.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Is a payment scheme part of the experiments you’re now launching?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Yes, absolutely. They have to pay.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Who pays: the university or the individual students?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> The individual has to pay. You wouldn’t be learning much in an experiment if someone else was paying for your music. Everybody would be for it, right? That wouldn’t be a good test.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You have not identified the universities that are participating — is that right? </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Right. For right now they have asked for their academic privacy. We don’t ask them to stay private — it is up to them. [Because] students are involved and it is an experiment that they are running, [the schools] ask us not to give out their names. But if they want to, that’s fine…. They are designing their programs now. It takes time. </p>
<p>What we have done is empowered them to search for a solution around collective licensing because this is something that they can only do when the licensing is being handled by someone else, because it is very difficult for them to get together and to license music.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> At this stage, you don’t know things like what percentage of students are opting in?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Don’t know yet. [The programs haven’t] started [as of the date of this interview]. I did say publicly — and I stand by it — that tens of thousands of students have indicated their willingness to pay because their school has come to us and said, “Look. We are willing to pay on behalf of all the students.” And we have said, “Well, you can’t pay on their behalf, but if you can collect money from them individually — that is fine.” Those schools have come to us and said, “We are willing to pay for everyone on our campus to get all the music they want.” It’s important to be point out in this debate is that students <em>are</em> willing to pay and groups of students are coming forward to say, “We are willing to pay <em>en masse</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Since you brought up your critics — you do have some.</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Oh, absolutely. I value that. I think it’s wonderful. There are lots of critics. But they are not critics of what we are doing because they don’t know what we are doing. It enrages them that they don’t know. </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In fact, that is one of the criticisms: that you’re working in secret and you then evade specifics by saying, “It’s just an experiment.”</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> But we’re dealing with schools. We didn’t come in with this attitude. The schools took us aside and said, “If want to work with schools, you have to respect academic privacy.”</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Once the experiment is underway can you — will you — talk about the aggregate outcomes and what revenue models seem to work?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Absolutely. It is up to those schools, because it is their results. </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Some of your critics refer to what you’re proposing as a “tax” on music downloads</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> That is ridiculous. They say it because when we first started talking about Choruss, <em>Wired</em> magazine called it a tax. The assumption was that we would require everyone to pay. Whenever you discuss compulsory licensing or collective licensing, some people think that it is going to be required. </p>
<p>There is a huge difference between requiring artists to be involved and requiring people to pay. And we are not dealing with compulsory licenses — it is voluntary both on the part of the rights holder and on the part of the student. </p>
<p>But when you simply enter into a discussion around compulsory licensing there is the belief that it is somehow going to be mandatory for the rights holder, or the musician, or the individual to pay. In our case that’s not true. We don’t require any student to pay. And we don’t require any artist to be in. </p>
<p>Some countries do use compulsory licensing. And there are some compulsory licenses in the United States — for example, for webcasters. Every artist has to permit their music to be used by a webcaster. They don’t get to decide. The government has adjudged that if you have released music commercially it can be used by a webcaster. That is a compulsory license. By no means does it require every webcaster to pay in that fashion. They could reach their own licensing agreements. And neither does it require individuals to pay webcasters. But it is compulsory upon the artists to permit their music to be used in that fashion. </p>
<p>And so it is easy to see how the debate gets lost and then someone says, “Oh, if it is a compulsory license then I am going to be compelled to pay.” That certainly doesn’t follow, but I see the misunderstanding. </p>
<p>What could be a tax about Choruss when the individual gets to decide if they pay and the artist gets to decide if they are in? That can’t be a tax, right? But in a headline it makes people read an article. If you say “music tax,” you will get a lot more hits on your article than if you say they are thinking deeply about how to get music paid for.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> If all goes well with your experiments, describe the situation in five or ten years in the future. </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> They have already turned out well. This is not just a test of how the market perceives music. It’s also a test of how rights holders come together to make that possible. And that behind the scenes work has been going on for two years, and we are learning a great deal about it.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of the things we have learned. When we started this experiment we were thinking about premises licensing. ASCAP, BMI and SESAC license premises or a radio station. They say to a restaurant or a radio station, “You can use our collection of songs.” Our thinking was, okay, we could go to [an institution’s computer] network — like we go to a pub or a radio station — and say, “On your network you can use the following collection of music in any way you like for your users.”</p>
<p>We started talking to students and they said, “I don’t want my music service to stop at my network’s borders.” We realized that 80% of the students live off campus. They have jobs off campus. They go home over the holidays. They don’t want their music service to stop at their network’s borders. Their music service needs to traverse network borders. </p>
<p>We immediately changed our thinking. We learned right away that monetizing networks isn’t the point. Networks may be the locus of the activity, but it is certainly not the solution in terms of monetizing the activity. </p>
<p>That is an example of learning that immediately gripped [us] to say: Okay, it’s not about monetizing a network. It is about creating a service that is monetized. That service can traverse networks. </p>
<p>Another example was: Some rights holders were very clear with us that they felt that in the future music money like this should be allocated on plays. They didn’t come to us with a degree of moral certitude, but they said, “We would like for you to experiment around new metrics for the allocation of the money that is collected.” </p>
<p>In a retail world, let’s say, you and I buy two records. One of those records we play a lot. And the other record we play not at all — we didn’t like it. Those artists got paid the same. Maybe in a future digital world the artist who gets played more should get paid more. Maybe. That is part of our learning. How does one figure that out? How do you know which music is played most often?</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How do you know how often a song gets played in a way that’s not intrusive to the user?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> I think most people don’t feel intruded upon by, say, Arbitron or Nielsen. Some people do. But I think when people get that diary in the mail along with the buck they honestly want to figure it out. While those ratings are flawed — and inherently so — they are good enough for commerce. We have an industry that rewards some performers better, some disc jockeys better, some announcers better, some networks better — because they have a better quality or quantity of crowd. So we do use those imperfect measures a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> So some of your models are looking at differential payment of artists? </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> But you are looking at a flat rate payment from the consumer — whether downloading one song or a thousand in a month?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> We are experimenting [both ways]. Because it may be that in some cases you would prefer to buy a niche as opposed to everything. You might say, “Jim, I’m a jazz fan. I don’t want to pay for polka music.” It may be that it is a more attractive offering to you to have a flat fee within a niche or a genre. We are not opposed to that. We simply want to learn what you want.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What is the incentive for the user — the student in this case — to opt in, other than the idea of doing the right thing? </p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> That is always going to be one of them. And a better service.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Are you also offering to get them out from under the threat of litigation?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> For us, that has nothing to do with it. In fact, I hope that’s not a factor because I don’t think they are suing people any more. And I certainly don’t think that’s [happening] on college campuses the way it used to. I don’t know because I’m not involved with that part. And we never were. Some people say, “Oh, well, this is the <em>quid pro quo</em> for that” –which is not accurate. Because we were doing this before they made any decisions with regard to that. </p>
<p>Of course, that has to be a backdrop, yet it’s not interesting to us because we are interested in what persuades people to pay — not what compels them to do so. </p>
<p>We think about how can we make the service better? We have a critical issue that is those who offer all music can do so because they license no music. In other words, piracy is one of the factors we are competing with. </p>
<p>We think we are competing more with a limited clock and a limited wallet. We don’t think our competition is pirates even though they are part of the competition. The biggest part of the competition is that there are other things for you to spend your money on and other ways for you to spend your time on other than music. And while music might be a part of your spending your time — there is music in video games and in movies. When I was a kid there were no cell phones, so I wasn’t spending money on cell phones. I wasn’t spending money on network services or electronic games. How do we compete for that share of the wallet that we used to have? How do we get your attention and have you spend the time on your limited clock listening to music and paying for music? And then, of course, there is piracy. </p>
<p>And so we think of that as a holistic problem, and we think, “How can we make it a better experience?” I spend a lot of time [on piratical networks] because I’m really interested in what people do and what they use — I have found that my experience is less than satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Does the RIAA know about this? [Laughs.]</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> Sure they do! And I think to their credit they are beginning to learn in checking that out, too.</p>
<p>Peered networks have a real advantage in their distribution of music — because it can arrive faster. It could be that it’s the person in the dorm room a floor below you that has the song you are looking for. And it will arrive faster if we pair you with that individual than if we sent it to you from a centralized server. And you want fast. You want efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What do you think is the likelihood that all these pieces will come together and we will get to a point where artists get their fair share of the payment, and users can download any song they want for a modest fee?</p>
<p><strong>Griffin:</strong> I think it is inevitable. The question is “When?” We do it now for radio and for television. We do it for pub owners. It does work. They can play any music they want and they are not considered pirates or thieves. </p>
<p>It is a shift for rights holders to think in this new way. But for users the shift has already occurred. They already get access to all the music they want. They already get to use it with great facility. And I think they are willing to pay, but we haven’t offered them the kind of model that is attractive to them. No one has ever offered an unlimited download, unlimited access model, with one flat fee without any DRM, without any controls at all. They’ve never been offered the thing that they are most likely to want to use. </p>

<p><span>An edited transcript of the conversation follows:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>You state that food is a result of capitalist supply and demand. It seems logical and simple, but people don’t think about food in those terms. How did you come up with that?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>I grew up as a kid reading classical economic works by Adam Smith, David Ricardo and James Mill. Those are the origins of economics, as we all know. For obvious reasons, they’re obsessed with food. That’s almost all they write about because that’s what the economy was about back then. If you have a background in classical economics, the notion that economics is about food comes very naturally. Maybe the world has forgotten that somewhat.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>In the Middle East, eating a more Westernized diet is a sign of worldliness but it may not be as healthy as eating traditional meals. How did the idea of local eating transform into a lower-status symbol?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>There’s a class division in a lot of those societies. You either do things that are Western to show you have money, but it’s not necessarily healthy. I think if they became a little more obsessed with, say Indian or Chinese food, they’ll do better. There are issues with diabetes and obesity in many of these wealthier Gulf nations. They also tend not to be physically active because that also has a stigma. So it’s one thing to eat if you’re physically active, you can get away with doing so much more.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, they have servants, and they import labor. A lot of people are just not working; they don’t have to work. That’s a lethal combination. And the idea of, "Oh, I’m going to go to the gym," like they say in America, it’s not the same there. It’s too much like work.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>You point out that there is no shortage of food in the world. But there is a shortage of money for poor people to buy the food. It seems almost ironic. What are the factors that affect this polar phenomenon?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>If you look at wheat and rice, there have been price spikes over the last five years and they’ve made food a lot harder for poor people to afford. The so-called "Green Revolution" has somewhat slowed down. This is an unreported story. Crop yields are stagnant. It isn’t a problem we can solve overnight but it’s really one of the biggest problems in the world. It hardly gets any publicity. But for poor people in India, the Middle East and parts of Africa, it really matters.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the problems are we don’t have enough trade. It could be either legal barriers or just costly to transport or trade things. If there could be a shortage of rice in one place, it actually not that easy to ship a lot of rice in there because of bad roads and so on.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>So if countries worked on improving the transportation infrastructure, that would lower food prices in some parts of the world?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Exactly, that would do a lot to feed people. Again, it sounds much more mundane but it’s more important than what people in the food world usually talk about.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>So when companies like Wal-Mart bring their logistics ability to Africa, it actually could be a good thing for the poor people of Africa?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>It’s exactly what we need more of. Yes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Yet there’s a fear Wal-Mart will put the smaller stores out of business.</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Yes, they do so sometimes, but they do so by charging lower prices. It makes it more accessible and more reliable. It’s not just the pricing at any one point and time. It’s what happens in the very worst periods. Companies like Wal-Mart are very, very good at keeping up supply and being regular.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Are there other things that people can do to feed the poor people in the Middle East, especially in the Arab nations that have undergone revolutions?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Well, they have very bad economic policies; it’s hard to know where to start. They tend to have bad energy and bad water policies. They overuse energy and they overuse water and protect their domestic farmers. It creates an unholy triad of subsidies with water, food and energy in a way that’s environmentally unsustainable. They should rely more on free trade. They tend not to trust it and I understand why, given their histories. But what they’re doing now isn’t really working.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Do you think people recognize that when they’re forming the new governments?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>I think very often they do. There are a lot of sophisticated people in the governments. But that doesn’t mean they have the power to set things straight.</span></p>
<p><span>Plus, it depends on which country in the Middle East you’re talking about. So Tunisia is better run than most places. Lebanon has a saner agricultural policy than most places. Yemen is a total disaster. Algeria and Egypt have not gone so well. So there’s a lot of variety within the Middle East. If you think of a model like Turkey, which isn’t technically in the Middle East, they’ve liberalized and encouraged agribusiness. Turks are much better fed than 20 years ago. When you ask a country like Iran, what should we do? It’s hard to know even where to start.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>As you said, Egypt hasn’t gone well. And Egypt is in the beginnings of forming a new government, it sounds like they have a very big uphill battle.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Yes, I think it’ll get worse before it gets better. They’re prevailing on economic policy based on mercantilism — powerful, bad, old-fashioned mercantilism in the greediest way. It doesn’t work. Mercantilism backed by military rule not a good idea.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>You point out that the Middle East imports about half of the wheat they use, which is needed for bread and other staples. This system of importing a food staple contributes to high food prices, which is one of the reasons for the political unrest and an impetus for the Arab revolutions. What can the Middle East do to reverse this trend?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Well, it’s not just up to the Middle East. One reason that wheat prices and other prices have gone up is because the world as a whole has slacked off in research and development in agricultural productivity. I don’t think the Middle East can solve that problem on its own.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Why has the world slacked off in such research and development?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>I don’t know. It’s a bigger public policy question. In a lot of areas, we’re spending more on short-term consumption and less on long-term investment. And I think that’s our fault. It’s a general trend and you see it in a lot of different countries.</span></p>
<p><span>Somehow, our time horizons are shortening. But most Middle Eastern countries do not have free trade in food. And if they did have free trade in food and didn’t protect their domestic farmers with subsidies, they would have cheaper food. So they treat their domestic farmers as a lobby that should be catered to when they should not. I wouldn’t suggest that would solve all their food problems. It wouldn’t.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>The domestic farmers would argue they would be put out of business.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Sure, but should Saudi Arabia be growing bananas and paying for all that water in the desert? It’s crazy. There’s a long history in many of these countries, trying to be self-sufficient with fairly outrageous water and farm subsidies, which raises prices. It costs a lot of money in the budget. It’s not really a successful path forward but it does buy the support of some interest groups of course. That’s why they do it.</span></p>
<p><span>But the notion of saying something simple like "Well, Lebanon has more water than we do so we should just stop subsidizing water and buy it from them." Those countries would be much better off.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>So if some of these countries just traded across borders?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Yes. I don’t mean to get into politics but Israel has the highest agricultural productivity in the Middle East. And they use technology much better. But a lot of countries are very reluctant to trade with Israel. Even share information and have any dealings at all. That’s another mistake they make and that’s part of the problem.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>While water is scarce in some regional countries, like Yemen, it’s actually abundant in Syria, Lebanon and Turkey. Can you explain more about the water inequality problem in the Middle East?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Typically, the Gulf has the worst problem with water. I’m not even sure Yemen is even a viable country because there’s some chance, they will literally run out of water in the next 20 years in a lot of parts of the country. At this point, I don’t know what they can do. Saudi Arabia is a lot wealthier and they’ve returned to some sanity. Every now and then, the price of oil dips and they decide they can’t afford to be as they used to be, so they cut back on their subsidies for the better. They ought to just say their domestic farmers have to pay the market price for their water. And if they can’t produce food at that price, we’ll buy from Lebanon, Turkey, Israel or wherever else.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>So to buy water and food products from other nations?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Often how you buy water is to buy it in the product. If you buy a tomato, one way to think of that transaction is you are buying water. It’s called virtual water, so yes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>In India, the economy is growing at 8 to 9% but agriculture is growing at 3% because agribusiness is not allowed. Can you explain the problem and discuss some of the solutions required?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>India has slowed down since the book came out. India is now at the 6% range. They have a climate that’s very hostile to agribusiness. They don’t want to let in Wal-Mart. They don’t let in generally consolidated land holdings. Agriculturally, they’re one of the least efficient countries. Half of the children under five are malnourished. And half of the workforce is in agriculture.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Why doesn’t India let agribusiness grow?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>They protect their own small farmers. The result of that is massive malnutrition, which have terrible consequences, not just for the kids, but for the whole country. People grow up and have inferior opportunities. One thing the world does know how to do, even in non-ideal countries, is to raise agricultural productivity. Turkey has done it. Most of South America has done it. But India has not been willing to take that step. It’s a huge, huge problem for them. Millions of people suffer in a very serious way.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Can you explain how the European fear for GMO’s (genetically modified organisms) is affecting Africa’s agricultural economy?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>There are a few reasons African countries are reluctant to use GMOs. Some of them do, mostly South Africa. But partly they don’t have the infrastructure to do it at all. And some are afraid that if they do, they can’t export to the European Union, which is their main market and more important than the United States. So they’ve held back on investing.</span></p>
<p><span>African agriculture has a lot of problems. But the biggest problem is simpler than GMOs. Africa has terrible roads. In Africa, it takes four to six time times to transport a product, which is crazy. It’s such a poor place. It’s relatively dry so they really need fertilizer. And to think an African farmer has to pay four to six times more than what an African farmer has to pay for fertilizer? A lot of that is because they have bad roads.</span></p>
<p><span>But not doing GMOs is part of a bigger, broader set of problems and it could make their agriculture more productive. I’m not sure injecting GMOs and doing nothing else will make a huge difference. If there’s no road to bring your crop to market, it doesn’t matter what you do to your crop. But it’s part of a series of big, interrelated problems.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>This fear of GMOs is more of a European fear than an American fear?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>Yes, that’s right. There’s a very small minority of Americans who worry about this kind of thing. In terms of law and public policy debate, it’s pretty much taken for granted. People have been eating GMO products for 20 years and there’s really no evidence of ill effects. Why is it this way in Europe? I don’t know. To me, it’s a bit like the right wing, climate change, etc. People start obsessing over it in a bad way and they’re not willing to face up to the evidence.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>In your book you point out New Zealand lamb. Its two biggest consumers are the U.S. and the Arab World. If segments of the U.S. population decided to boycott New Zealand lamb due to transportation not being environmentally friendly, how would that effect prices in the Arab World?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Cowen:</span></strong> <span>In that example, I just tried to point out that boycotts are often not very effective. They make people feel good. If you get a lot of people to boycott, people somewhere else will just buy more of it. There’s a system-wide effect. In general, I tend to be skeptical of boycotts as a way to change the world. Sometimes they work but more often than not, they don’t.</span></p>

						<p>An old term of questionable meaning is getting a new lease on life: Trickle-down economics. And to many in media and liberal circles, it has once again emerged as the great hobgoblin of our time.</p>
<p>“Trump and conservatives in Congress are planning a big tax cut for millionaires and billionaires,” Robert Reich, who served as secretary of labor during the Clinton administration, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trumps-tax-cuts-rich-wont-work-682312">wrote in <em>Newsweek</em> recently</a>. “To justify it they’re using the oldest song in their playbook, claiming tax cuts on the rich will trickle down to working families in the form of stronger economic growth. Baloney. Trickle-down economics is a cruel joke.”</p>
<p>But what is trickle-down economics? The answer depends on who is saying it and what public opinion buttons they are trying to press. <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/smetters/" target="_blank">Kent Smetters</a>, Wharton professor of business economics and public policy, says that trickle-down economics is a term created to disparage supply-side economics.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>“It is just a clever negative sound bite,” says Smetters, faculty director of the <a target="_blank" href="http://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/">Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM)</a>. “Detractors claim that supply-side economics is about giving tax breaks to the rich. The rich then engage in more economic behavior, such as buying more stuff or hiring more workers; that eventually ‘trickles down’ to the non-rich who get the crumbs that fall from the table.”</p>
<p>Many others have pointed out the folly of using the term — that no real economic model or serious school of thought stands behind what has long been a term of art at the intersection of politics and media. “I have a little bit of a hard time with the terminology and the idea of trickle-down economics,” says Wharton professor of finance Joao F. Gomes. “Although everyone in the popular press has a somewhat different characterization of what this means, this is not something we have tested or seriously theorized about as economists.”</p>
<p>But if there is no substance behind trickle-down — just pejorative intent — the Trump administration itself has curiously invoked the term in its zeal to sell its tax plan to the American public.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that we’ve set out to create a tax cut for the wealthy. If someone’s getting a tax cut, I’m not upset that they’re getting a tax cut. I’m really not upset,” Gary Cohn, President Trump’s chief economic adviser, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/09/gary-cohn-trickle-down-is-good-for-the-economy.html">told CNBC recently</a>. “We create wage inflation, which means the workers get paid more; the workers have more disposable income, the workers spend more. And we see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that’s good for the economy.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Describing this view as ‘trickle-down economics’ would be akin to supply-siders describing their detractors as communists, a label that would certainly be rejected as well.”<span class="attribution">–Kent Smetters</span></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not clear that most Americans believe that anything good will eventually trickle down to them from the still-unfinished overhaul. When asked who the Republican tax plan would help most, 76% of respondents to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-americans-say-tax-plan-helps-wealthy-not-middle-class/">a December 2-5 CBS poll</a> of 1,120 adults nationwide said it would be large corporations, with 69% saying wealthy Americans would benefit most. Just 31% named the middle class as winners, with “you and your family” trailing at 24%.</p>
<p><strong>A Politically Infused Etymology</strong></p>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines the particularly colorful phrase trickle down as the notion that wealth will “gradually benefit the poorest as a result of the increasing wealth of the richest.” The term’s popularization is often traced to <a target="_blank" href="http://wiredpen.com/2015/01/30/will-rogers-trickle-economics/">a 1932 syndicated column</a> by Will Rogers in which the humorist referred to money “appropriated for the top in the hopes that it would trickle down to the needy. Mr. Hoover was an engineer. He knew that water trickles down. Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn’t know that money trickled up. Give it to the people at the bottom and the people at the top will have it before night, anyhow.”</p>
<p>“Favors for the few and prayers for the many” is what Adlai Stevenson II called it in an address to a 1954 Democratic Party rally in Detroit while stumping nationally for candidates.</p>
<p>A 1971 <em>New York Times</em> editorial referred to organized labor’s view that President Nixon was embracing “old-line ‘trickle down’ economics in the conventional Republican mold” by suggesting that “workers will benefit most by large-scale tax concessions to industry designed to spur investment in modernized plants and thus strengthen the competitive position of American business.”</p>
<p>And when President Ford proposed a tax overhaul in 1974, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy dismissed it as “a throwback to the trickle-down economics the nation has traditionally had to suffer under Republican Presidents.”</p>
<p>The phrase’s resonance today, of course, emanates from the Reagan era, and while it may have stood the test of time, longevity has not conferred clarity. Part of the problem is that “trickle down” lacks a universally understood meaning. Smetters says the idea of tax breaks for the rich eventually producing benefits to the poor has never been part of supply-side economics.</p>
<p>“Supply-siders believe — correctly or not — that lower taxes lifts all boats together,” he says. “Growth is not a flow of resources that cascade from rich to non-rich. In fact, many supply-siders argue that lower taxes benefit workers more than capital owners through international capital flows. Whether this argument is right or wrong is a legitimate issue. But describing this view as ‘trickle-down economics’ would be akin to supply-siders describing their detractors as communists, a label that would certainly be rejected as well.”</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Semantics aside, most agree that the right kind of stimulus can be efficacious to growth. “The term ‘trickle-down economics’ doesn’t really represent a cohesive economic theory,” says Wharton professor of business economics and public policy <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/benlo/" target="_blank">Benjamin Lockwood</a>. “It’s a term used, often negatively, to characterize the view that reducing taxes on the rich will benefit the non-rich.”</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why tax cuts for high earners could theoretically make others better off, he says. “Economists have long emphasized that taxes don’t necessarily ‘stick’ where you levy them — for example, a tax cut on corporate profits could raise workers’ wages. And if taxes are very high, reducing them can theoretically spur economic activity enough that tax revenues actually increase, which may have been the case in the 1950s, when top income tax rates exceeded 90%.”</p>
<p>However, he says, there’s little evidence to suggest that this would be the case for the current GOP proposal. “Most recent estimates suggest that the majority of corporate income taxes fall on business owners and shareholders, with only a minority falling on wages. And the fiscal crisis generated by Kansas’s recent tax cuts suggests today’s tax rates aren’t high enough for such cuts to be revenue-generating.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“How much growth will we get from this plan? It depends on final details and things we truly don’t know much about.”<span class="attribution">–<a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/gomesj/" target="_blank">Joao Gomes</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>The current tax bill is still a moving target, but the Penn Wharton Budget Model finds that the boost to GDP produced by the tax cuts would not be enough to pay for the tax cuts.</p>
<p>Lower taxes will probably add to growth. “Almost all economists accept that,” says Gomes. “How much and for how long is another question, and that’s where we disagree. There are several reasons for that. Some of us will say it is because lower taxes encourage people to work more and maybe corporations to invest more. If the tax cuts are long lived, this will raise national income for a long time. Republicans tend to start from this point.” Others will say it is because lower taxes will put money in people’s pockets and encourage spending which in turn creates jobs for a short time, even when the tax cuts are also temporary, Gomes adds. “Democrats tend to start from here. Indeed, this was the rationale for temporary cuts under President Obama. As I said, most economists agree that each of these arguments has merit. However, long-term cuts that stimulate work and investment cost more money and tend to benefit people who pay higher rates and/or capital gains taxes. These tend to be higher-income individuals.”</p>
<p>Do tax cuts pay for themselves, as some like to suggest?</p>
<p>“Almost surely not,” says Gomes. “But it is also important to say, to be absolutely fair, neither does spending on infrastructure, and that has not stopped left-wing economists from proposing it with the same fuzzy math that right-wingers support with these cuts. For an unbiased observer, there really is very little to choose between the fiscal probity of Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>“How much growth will we get from this plan? It depends on final details and things we truly don’t know much about,” Gomes continues. “Will it encourage people to work more? I would estimate yes, maybe a little but not very much. Will it encourage investment? Absolutely. Will it encourage corporations to relocate operations to the U.S.? Maybe, but the details are going to matter a lot.”</p>
<p><strong>Looking for Growth in All the Right Places </strong></p>
<p>The details of the tax plan are still opaque. One key unknown is the extent to which tax savings might be applied in ways that produce growth.</p>
<p>“Under the current tax proposal, the trickle-down economics becomes: ‘we’ll give a big cut in the corporate tax rate with the hope that those workers will benefit from the resulting new investment.’ It’s not surprising that if you tax returns on investments less there will be more investments,” says Robert P. Inman, Wharton professor of finance. “The real question becomes: How big of an effect on investment will there be, and if there is new investment in capital, will it benefit workers?</p>
<blockquote><p>“The term ‘trickle-down economics’ doesn’t really represent a cohesive economic theory.”<span class="attribution">–Benjamin Lockwood</span></p></blockquote>
<p>“For example, if businesses invest that in existing real estate or share buy-backs,” Inman continues, “there is probably not going to be much of an impact on employment or worker wages. However, investing in a new building or in new capital equipment will employ people and potentially increase worker productivity. In that case there will be a positive effect on employment and on worker wages.”</p>
<p>But how many jobs? And wages of what kind?</p>
<p>“I suspect most of the new machinery will be very sophisticated, high-tech, investment. If so, the trickle down, the wage premium for those at the lower ends of the income distribution, will be rather modest. The trickle-down will probably stop at [jobs paying] about $50,000.”</p>
<p>Inman recalls the effects of President George W. Bush’s 2004-2005 overseas corporate profits repatriation program. “The idea was that it would lead to a big influx of cash on the investment side, but what corporations ended up doing was buying back shares. That was an investment, but an investment that didn’t create any jobs.”</p>
<p>Of the new tax plan’s repatriation of earnings — about $2.5 trillion sitting offshore — that would be automatically brought home and taxed at a special rate, Smetters says it’s likely that some of it will translate into higher dividends, some into stock repurchases and some of it will be invested. “We don’t think the investment channel is going to be nearly as big as some people will say, and the reason why is that there are already some ways of clever financing,” he recently said <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-rising-deficits-huge-loopholes-and-paltry-family-gains-plague-tax-reform/">in a separate Knowledge@Wharton interview</a>.</p>
<p>Inman does believe that lowering the corporate tax rate makes sense, but that it needs to happen along with closing loopholes. “Close the loopholes, then see how much money you have and lower the tax rate accordingly,” he suggests.</p>
<p>On the question of whether the GOP’s plan will increase income and wealth inequality, a lot depends on what the exact changes to the estate tax end up being, says Gomes. “Still, from an inequality standpoint it would be great to see the elimination of the state and local tax and home mortgage deductions, which are mostly gifts to the top 20% of the income distribution. Eliminating these deductions while cutting tax rates is also the sort of ‘revenue neutral’ change that most economists would applaud.”</p>
<p>One aspect of this debate that is under-emphasized, says Lockwood, is the potential for other types of targeted tax cuts to generate beneficial spillovers. These are benefits that could bubble up from low earners, or flow sideways from middle earners, rather than trickling down from the top.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is evidence that cutting taxes, or targeting spending, on specific middle-class professions, including teaching and basic research, would have quite large beneficial spillovers.”<span class="attribution">–Benjamin Lockwood</span></p></blockquote>
<p>“In fact, there is evidence that cutting taxes, or targeting spending, on specific middle-class professions, including teaching and basic research, would have quite large beneficial spillovers,” he says. In a recent paper co-authored with Charles G. Nathanson of Northwestern University and E. Glen Weyl of Microsoft Research and Yale University, Lockwood writes that some professions have “spillovers” — that the social value of an individual’s work can be much higher, or much lower, than that individual’s compensation.</p>
<p>“Some spillovers are quite large,” they write in a <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2017/10/what-if-socially-useful-jobs-were-taxed-less-than-other-jobs"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> piece</a> about the paper “<a target="_blank" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1324424">Taxation and the Allocation of Talent</a>,” published in the <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>. “Given <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.9.2633">how much</a> good teachers raise the eventual incomes of their students, we calculate that spillovers from teachers are twice as large as the salaries teachers are paid. The benefits from medical research are even larger, amounting to over one-fifth of total income in the U.S. “On the other hand, some sectors involve ‘zero sum’ endeavors, in which profits come at the expense of other market participants. Examples include excessive litigation or financial traders trying to beat the market.”</p>
<p>They examine two potential types of tax policies. In one, raising top tax rates would, in theory, encourage workers to choose lower-paying jobs, compelling some to gravitate toward more socially valuable professions. In the other, the government would tax or subsidize some professions more than others.</p>
<p>The first approach would do little to spur economic growth, they conclude. The second could boost growth dramatically. Rather than advocating a rewrite of tax code with different rates for different jobs, the authors recommend a rewards system that would raise salaries and award merit pay.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is no economist who doesn’t agree that if you give somebody money, it’s going to have effects elsewhere in the economy. The only issue is how do those effects play out….”<span class="attribution">–<a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/inman/" target="_blank">Robert Inman</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Of growth stimulators in the current GOP tax proposal, Gomes says one aspect that is appealing is the expensing of investment. Firms will be allowed to deduct all investment expenses from their corporate taxes immediately, instead of slowly over time. “This change more than any others should encourage them to invest and boost our economy in the short and long runs. It’s a clever idea that economists have been advocating for years on the left and the right,” he says.</p>
<p>What he likes least: The fact that the plan is unlikely to pay for itself. “We should be raising revenues elsewhere to offset the cost of [many] good ideas. We are adding to the burden of the federal debt when we should be reducing it. Admittedly it’s not a lot relative to GDP, and the bond market is not concerned about the government’s ability to repay higher debt. But it goes in the wrong direction.”</p>
<p>Gomes says “there are several good ideas in the plan. The main problems might be the overall cost and the lack of phase-in for some of the changes that are likely to be very disruptive.”</p>
<p>It is, however, a complex plan, he says, and “obviously Republicans exaggerate its virtues and Democrats the defects. The truth is in the middle.”</p>
<p>Fluidic imagery aside, change is coming. Says Inman: “There is no economist who doesn’t agree that if you give somebody money, it’s going to have effects elsewhere in the economy. The only issue is how do those effects play out, and who are the beneficiaries?</p>
<p>For conservatives, he notes, “trickle-down is a flood, and for liberals it’s a drip.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Last year ended in Argentina with inflation at twice its 2004 rate. According to the latest data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC), the cost of living rose 1.1% during December. Inflation for the entire 12 months reached 12.3%, compared with 6.1% during 2004. Experts say inflation is the main challenge facing the country’s brand-new minister of economics, Felisa Miceli.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Twenty days after she took office, Miceli confirmed that fact in her first meeting with business leaders. “Inflation is the government’s key challenge,” she said. Miceli also explained that in Argentina “it is more dangerous when prices rise above normal levels than it is when that happens in other countries.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="o051"><span>Miceli is the first woman in Argentine history to become Economics Minister. Before assuming that position, she held other public positions, most recently president of Argentina’s Banco Nación. Her mentor is Roberto Lavagna, the former finance minister whom she replaced last December as one of the most loyal supporters of President N</span></span><span>é<span class="o051"><span>stor Kirchner. “Lavagna had his own base of support and political power, and his own reputation in markets,” comments</span></span></span> <span lang="ES-AR"><a target="_blank" href="http://www-management.wharton.upenn.edu/mcdermott/"><span lang="EN-US">Gerald A. McDermott</span></a></span><span class="o051"><span>, a management professor at Wharton. For all that, “the whole world thinks that Miceli is simply a puppet of Kirchner, someone who never had an economic policy during 12 years in the government of Santa Cruz province,” notes McDermott. According to some surveys, more than half of all Argentines do not approve of the removal of Lavagna.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>As a result, most analysts feel that Miceli will need to demonstrate that she can function autonomously, especially during the first six months of this year. Sebastian Galiano, an economics professor at the University of San Andrés (UDESA), suggests that, short term, the main challenge for Miceli will be to slow down the growth in nominal demand. Galiano says that in 2005, nominal demand “grew by 20%, which was reflected in the 8% growth in production of goods and services, and the 12% rise in prices. The problem is that total investment is still down. Given the levels where it is now, the economy has the potential to grow by no more than 3.5%. So if they don’t slow down the growth in nominal demand, inflation could get out of control. Even if they don’t do that, it [inflation] will not drop from current levels.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The first task Miceli tackled after taking her new job was to launch a “mega”-agreement with supermarkets and manufacturers to bring about a 15% drop in the prices of more than 150 products considered basic necessities.<span class="e072"><span>This showed that her top priority is controlling prices.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although the agreement brought some positive results in supermarket aisles and department stores, it did not have that much of an impact on prices of beef, the most important ingredient on Argentinian dinner tables. Clearly, not all of the products that were subject to Miceli’s proposal wound up dropping their prices by 15%. In addition, many retailers were left without sufficient inventory, so consumers were unable to take advantage of lower prices.</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Galiano insists that to solve inflation, Argentina must focus on every aspect of it. “First, you have to get people to stop talking about short-term inflation and talk about long-term inflation. Second, you have to repair the pricing system for [Argentina’s] privatized companies.” Prices for public utilities, including water and gas, have been frozen ever since the Argentine currency was devalued four years ago. That means prices still have not been brought up to date.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="e072"><span>Another measure Miceli undertook, three weeks ago, was to establish a Banco Nación credit plan valued at $1.5 billion to provide companies with the opportunity to expand, purchase machinery, and acquire manufacturing inputs.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="CS">McDermott agrees that, in addition to the urgent need to expand investment in fixed capital, the challenge for 2006 is “the reconstruction of regulatory regimes and regulatory institutions in capital markets and public services. Most of them were poorly done during the 1990s, and Kirchner does not have much credibility in this sense. Nor does Julio de Vido, his minister of infrastructure.“</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Nevertheless, in a recent Interview, Miceli said that “prices for services will not be renegotiated” in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>The Double-Edged Sword of Paying the Debt</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>With the broad smile that characterizes all her press conferences, Miceli stood alongside Martin Redrado, head of the country’s Central Bank, a few days ago, to confirm that Argentina was repaying the debt it owed to the International Monetary Fund. On January 3, the sum of $9.53 billion in special draft rights was canceled in advance as a result of a personal decision by President Kirchner.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This long anticipated move gave Miceli a few moments to relax during her arduous negotiation sessions with various kinds of food producers. She is still trying to get them to lower their prices.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>However, no one can say if the payment to the IMF will have a positive impact on Argentina. “It could be favorable but there are still no signs of that,” comments McDermott. In the current context, he says, “the appropriate fiscal policy is one that reduces the level of net indebtedness for the government. The repayment to the IMF does not do that; it replaces one liability with another one. In other words, it cancels external liabilities in favor of external assets of the Central Bank. The net indebtedness does not change.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>There are several areas of disagreement concerning the problems that could be in store for the Central Bank if more than $9.5 billion in reserves leaves the country. “It could be a problem if, as the result of the least little short-term financing need, the National Treasury reduces its fiscal surplus,” says Galiano. “When it comes to financial operations, in order for the Central Bank to disperse the reserves, the Treasury compensates the Central Bank with a non-transferable draft letter, payable in dollars over a ten year period, valued at the same amount as the canceled debt, which equalizes its liabilities and its assets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>McDermott wonders, somewhat critically: “Is the Central Bank now simply another department of the [Argentine] Presidency?” He believes that the institution should operate totally autonomously of the federal government.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Beyond the real impact of repaying or not repaying the IMF, there are other economic problems that must be resolved. McDermott advises observers not to overlook such challenges as Argentina’s “credibility in international markets, its institutional development for supporting the competitiveness and innovation of exporting sectors, and [domestic] poverty [within Argentina].”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>On the other hand, experts point out that Argentina’s debt with the IMF is only a small portion of the country’s total foreign debt, which is now $124.332 billion.</span></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once again, the Real Madrid football team has broken the record for sports signings, paying 94 million euros for Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo, and 65 million euros for Brazil’s Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, otherwise known as Kaká. But how will these moves play in terms of public relations, especially in the current economic climate? And will the team be able to recover its investment? In an interview with Universia Knowledge@Wharton, Antonio Martín, director of the IE Business School’s graduate program in sports management, and Francesc Pujol, member of the University of Navarre’s Economics, Sports and Intangibles Research Group, respond to these and other questions about the business of sports. The two scholars recently published a report about the marketing value of football in the 2008-9 season.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>UK@W: </strong>Sports, in general — and football, in particular — is a business that deals in billions of euros, even during the current economic downturn. Caja Madrid and Santander banks will underwrite the recent signings of Real Madrid with loans of 153 million euros. Are the two football players — Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká — worth that price? Do you believe that this investment will wind up being profitable for Real Madrid?</font></font></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>Antonio Martín:</strong> The reality is that the price of a soccer player winds up being set by the marketplace, based on the interests of the two clubs and the interest of the player. It is unimportant to try to find any rational reason for this price. It is true that these figures have an impact, and that we are in a very difficult economic situation. But people are also buying and selling companies, and we don’t question the salaries of other kinds of social figures such as business executives, artists and politicians. Soccer clubs like Real Madrid, FC. Barcelona, Manchester United and Chelsea are authentic sports multinationals. Their budgets far surpass 300 million euros, and in some cases approach 400 million. Any of them would be in the highest ranks of companies in many countries.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a result of these contracts, the value of corporate sponsorships [of Real Madrid] clearly increases. This gives Real Madrid the chance to renegotiate its contracts with its sponsors. This is about players whose media exposure goes beyond one country or one continent because they are athletes of global standing. As a result, the Real Madrid brand gets a very strong boost, more than it already has, and that opens new routes to sponsorship for it. When it comes to sponsors with a national reach – Mahou beer – and those with a global reach – Audi – perhaps these contracts enable those sponsors to aspire to improve their global brand. [It also allows Real Madrid] to search for sponsorships on a local level in other countries…. For example, Real Madrid could negotiate a sponsorship deal with a Japanese or Latin American beer. It could do this because its global positioning has clearly grown.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, there are other routes to pursue such as radio and TV rights. This much is clear: Real Madrid has already sold those rights to the Mediapro production company at a closed, fixed price. But when the club organizes a tour, an exhibition game or some unusual event, Real Madrid is now a brand with better global positioning, so its radio and TV rights will have a higher value. All of those activities are <em>in situ</em> businesses, such as visits to the stadium, food purchases, merchandising. Beyond that, its brand will grow because of the fact that the team is now much better known.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The improvement in Real Madrid’s global positioning also opens new horizons for it in the realm of [product] licensing. Beyond uniform shirts, there are an infinite number of products that could bring [overall merchandising] revenues of some 10 million euros. In the past, the team was able to take in between 5 million and 7 million euros from merchandising. Now, thanks to these contracts, it could take in 2 million or 3 million additional euros as a result of added interest from other countries, markets and product sectors. With respect to tours and exhibition games, Real Madrid used to earn 1.5 million or 2 million euros for playing in China or the U.S. Now, they are in a position to ask for a higher sum. It adds up to a significant amount of money if, over the course of four or five years, the team can improve its revenue stream for every pre-season game by 20% to 30%, compared with before [the signings]. In addition, there are other aspects of the club that benefit a great deal. For example, Real Madrid’s TV channel can sell programs about the team’s activities and events that attracted less interest in the past. Now, when the [two] new players are introduced, many channels will ask them for interviews. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These revenue streams are not just going to come from [sales of] team jerseys, the way many people think. The big question is: How long will it take Real Madrid to recover its investment? Don’t forget that we are talking about athletes, and it depends on how well the players perform — the results that they achieve [on the field], and whether they are injured. Using a range of economic figures, we can conclude that, at best, they will manage to recover their investment within five or six years. But you have to remember that we are talking about people, about athletes.</font></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>Francesc Pujol: </strong>The point of departure for our analysis leads us to say that you have to view these contracts as an investment. That’s the way Real Madrid and the banks have looked at this. As an investment, this calculation of future profitability is tied to uncertainties. And like every investment, this one is subject to risks. The first thing that you have to figure out is this: Have they bought these assets for a price that gives the team a reasonable chance of recovering its costs? Have they paid too much? In our analysis, based on these athletes’ media value, we were able to establish a fair market price for Cristiano Ronaldo of 82 million euros, and for Kaká of 63 million. Our interpretation of this data (based on an econometric analysis of the transactions in the marketplace over the past three seasons, for more than 300 signings) is that the overall marketplace is not wrong. And if the market does not make mistakes, and if these evaluations are made in a way that makes buyers and sellers happy, then this means that they [Real Madrid] should be able to recover their investment in the five years that were forecasted.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We conclude that Kaká’s signing price is not excessive because the money that is being spent on him should be recovered. Ronaldo’s higher signing price makes sense for him, nevertheless, even if the team paid 94 million euros for him plus commissions; it is not very clear if commissions are included. We have estimated Ronaldo’s value at 82 million euros. This means that they themselves are working from a broadly optimistic scenario about the future. Short term, it is clear that they are going to increase their revenues after these stars join the team. However, it is an investment that they have to get a return from within the next five years. The current value of Ronaldo and Kaká, in media terms, is at the highest level, and this generates revenue. However, in order to recover this investment, they’ll have to wait another two, three or five years when these athletes’ media value rises [still] higher. By paying more than they needed to, what Real Madrid is saying is, “We hope that the value of these players in the media continues to go up over the next few years; we hope that we win championships and a European Cup, and we recover our investment that way.” However, this scenario could turn out to be too optimistic. If their performance [on the playing field] is only ‘okay’ they won’t recover all of their investment. And if their performance as players is bad, [Real Madrid] will lose a significant amount [of money].</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>UK@W: </strong>These signings coincide with the return of Florentino Pérez to the leadership of Real Madrid after his departure nine years ago. But the current economic context is very different. At times like these, when excessive executive compensation has been criticized so much, do you believe that paying these sorts of salaries could damage the image of Real Madrid or any other team that commits such excesses?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>A.M.:</strong> On the one hand, fans and members remember Florentino Pérez more for the positive things than the negatives. [The team won several titles between 2001 and 2003, but they didn’t win anything else until 2006, when he resigned.] These signings act as motivators, especially after the results of the latest season [when they did not win any title], when they lost at home to Barcelona by a score of six to two.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for salaries, athletes have a very limited professional lifetime. And, on the other hand, when we talk about these numbers, although they are certainly spectacular, it is socially acceptable for athletes and professionals to be remunerated far above the usual average. I don’t believe that this idea is offensive if people devote themselves to a club, or wear the team’s colors, and so forth. Perhaps the larger problem is for the financial institutions that provide the money, but I don’t believe that Real Madrid will be harmed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>F.P:</strong> People who are not soccer fans view the sport as something that attracts too much attention. But those people and the press are not very important for Real Madrid because those people weren’t buying uniforms or tickets before [the signings] and they won’t buy them now. What’s more important about these deals is the public perception of Real Madrid and the brands with which it may want to associate itself. We’ll have to see what the perception [of the team] will be over the long term. Short term, all the communications media are getting involved, along with all sorts of analysts. So factors that have nothing to do with football itself are having a growing impact. But over the long term, what ultimately matters is the impact that Real Madrid’s athletic performance is going to have [on the value of its brand]. What matters is the kind of impact the signings have [on the brand] and whether the Real Madrid brand rises or falls [as a result.]</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>UK@W: </strong>Looking beyond soccer, what does the profitability of sports events depend on nowadays? How is the economic crisis affecting sports? What changes will we be able to see over the short and medium term as a result of today’s adverse conditions?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>A.M.:</strong> There are two types of revenue streams: Direct revenues from the event itself, through sponsorship, ticket sales, food sales inside the stadium and the athletic complex; merchandising and media rights; everything that the event itself can generate. Then, there are the indirect revenues, which come through the promotion of the event. When you organize a tennis or PGA tournament, the city and the country benefit because you manage to put it on the map all around the world. Then, there are the activities that you do jointly with your sponsors. That is to say, a sponsor can promote an event because it is interested in having the people know that it is associated with it. For example, Repsol gives “free” publicity to the F1 trials in Montmeló, Barcelona, and announces that between six and eight months before tickets are sold.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Companies have cut their marketing and communications budgets, and there is a direct relationship here. Those companies and institutions that are involved in the sports world are experiencing the same kinds of problems as companies in the consumer goods sector; that is, a significant decline in consumer spending, lower budgets and overall cuts. I don’t think that we will see any drastic changes. What we will see is that clubs and event organizers will tighten their belts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>F.P.:</strong> The sports world is a business sector very much like films and music, and it is very closely tied to the spectacles that it presents. You don’t measure it by the quality of the product that you are offering, but you value it as a function of the media impact it generates. It can have a great deal of value but if you are not aware of that value, you cannot make money from it. It is a sector where visibility is everything, and visibility is provided through the communications media. The capacity of a club, or tennis player or sports event to generate income is tied to the media value that it generates, and that value is tied to its athletic success. However, there are some media events that have more media impact than others. How much impact you have in the media decides the value of the brand and the visibility of that brand. That visibility is what generates revenues later on through television rights and sponsorship contracts.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The structure of revenues from sports events is tied to advertising: directly, through sponsorship, and indirectly, through television rights that are financed through advertising. During times of crisis, advertising rights decline significantly. Although the media impact of sports events does not decline, the profitability of this media impact declines because the sponsorship and advertising pie is reduced, because companies don’t have access to cash to spend on brand image or on advertising. In that sense, although we don’t see any drop off in the media impact of sports, since the pie has been reduced the news generated by a sports event generates less profitability during a crisis than it does during good economic times.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those sports events that have an inflexible spending structure will suffer, as well as those that cannot reduce their costs. That’s because revenues will decline by 20% or 30%. There are some events that are closely tied to prizes that they have to deliver, or to premiums that they have to pay to one group or another. Those companies that are unable to reduce this [kind of expenditure] are going to suffer because they won’t have enough financial muscle to deal with two bad years, and they won’t be able to meet their expenses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>UK@W: </strong>From the viewpoint of soccer players, how do you divide the revenue pie? Are athletes well advised today when it comes to where and how they should be investing their millions?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> <strong>A.M.:</strong> Generally speaking, elite athletes, both in soccer and the NBA, are very well advised, potentially. They have a representative who manages what they earn from sports, and an entire group of advisors, including lawyers to deal with contracts; tax advisors, who play a very important role in this type of contracts; and investment advisors, who invest their money. The teams themselves are the first people to care about whether athletes have a hard time dealing with these areas; they are careful to see that their athletes address tax issues correctly. The last thing they want is scandals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>F.P.:</strong> There is a strong infrastructure for generating a higher level of revenues [for athletes], both from marketing and legal points of view; a support structure that permits each player to maximize the revenues he can earn by taking advantage of his media impact. There are some companies in the sector, such as Havas Sport, whose mission is to set up contracts with business agents so that major athletes can maximize their ability to make money. At the same time, they make sure that the brands these athletes associate with do not wind up lowering the players’ value. In that regard, these companies are very accomplished and professional. The other part — what they do with the money they earn — is left more to the judgment of the player’s business agent. That depends on whether the player is getting good advice from his agent.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>UK@W: </strong>Off the playing field, has the role of team managers been professionalized a great deal? In what areas does someone have to be outstanding or a specialist in order to find a job in this sort of institution?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><strong>A.M.:</strong> Sports and sporting events are a very ephemeral product. A season lasts nine months, and an event lasts only a few days. Managers need to be very well trained professionals who are used to making very quick decisions. There is a growing shortage of people who are well prepared, and who have a certain level of specialization. In the past, the mindset was that clubs had a single director who did everything; that idea has been replaced by a general manager and various people who are in charge of specific areas, such as taxes, administration, and so forth.</font></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In early October, Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for their research, conducted independently, into how individuals make economic decisions. The two professors discovered that investors are not systematically rational, as traditional economic theory asserts (much of Kahneman’s research, it should be noted, was conducted with his longtime collaborator, the late Amos Tversky). Investors make decisions for emotional reasons, they base their decisions on shaky premises, they are quick to see cause and effect where there may be none, and so on. The professors’ research provided an impetus, respectively, to the burgeoning fields of behavioral finance and experimental economics.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So what does this mean for the markets? Since the stock market is based on the cumulative decisions of individuals, does this suggest that the market isn’t efficient at determining the correct prices of stocks? Do arbitrage opportunities abound?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>A few days before Kahneman and Smith got their phone calls from the Nobel Prize committee, Wharton hosted a debate that addressed these questions. Called “Two Views of Market Efficiency: A Discussion of Behavioral Finance and Efficient Market Theory,” the scrimmage took place between Burton Malkiel and Richard Thaler, and was moderated by Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeremysiegel.com/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a>, author of <em>Stocks for the Long Run</em>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Malkiel, a </span><span>Princeton</span><span> </span><span>University</span><span> finance professor and author of the famed <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street, </em>represented the efficient-markets camp. This group argues that the market is a mechanism that utilizes the collective information of stock market participants to produce efficient prices, and that there is no easy money – fresh $100 bills lying on the ground – for investors to make by predicting how stocks will behave. In other words, it’s hard to consistently beat the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler, a finance professor at the </span><span>University</span><span> of </span><span>Chicago</span><span> and a principal at Fuller &amp; Thaler Asset Management, a money management firm based in </span><span>San Mateo</span><span>, </span><span>Calif.</span><span>, took up the cudgels for the behavioral finance camp. He reflected the view that psychology plays a large role in the movement of stock prices and that patterns, or predictabilities, exist in the market that can be profitably arbitraged.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Both professors staked out common ground – at least initially. The market is not so rational that patterns in stock prices can’t be discerned, observed Malkiel. He admitted that psychological factors affect the stock market and that markets overshoot, creating bubbles such as the Internet technology craze of the late 1990s that lifted stock prices to untenable levels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>However, he said, “none of the patterns that have been discovered have been dependable, many have self-destructed as soon as they have been discovered, and many aren’t economically meaningful.” The patterns that endure are often too small to take advantage of, given the transactions costs associated with the trades. Or the trades are too risky. “I truly believe that our capital markets are remarkably efficient,” he continued. “The stock market is far less predictable than many of my academic colleagues have asserted. While the market is not statistically a perfect random walk, in my judgment investors would be very well-advised to act as if it was essentially unpredictable.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler also claimed what he described as the “sensible” middle ground. “Securities prices are highly correlated with intrinsic value, but sometimes diverge to a significant degree,” he said. “It’s possible to predict stock prices, but not with great precision – and don’t try this at home.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>That said, the two professors pursued their separate views of the market.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Malkiel gave a few examples of alleged predictabilities that, he said, on closer reflection don’t hold up. One is the popular suggestion that growth stocks perform better over the long haul than value stocks. Even if it were true for a period, he said, there could be two explanations. One is the behavioralist explanation, which is that investors are overconfident in their ability to predict growth stocks and therefore overprice growth stocks. The other is the belief that efficient-market proponents hold – that if there’s a pattern for some time, it could be because the value stocks are actually riskier. In other examples, Malkiel noted that patterns in stock prices that get chalked up to investors being exuberant or pessimistic could simply be the adjustment of stock prices to economic conditions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For those in the efficient-market camp, however, the most convincing proof of the efficiency of the market is the fact that professional portfolio managers cannot consistently outperform the market. “Surely,” said Malkiel, “if the market were always dominated by irrational investors, if it systematically deviated from what were rational estimates of value, professionals who are richly incentivized to outperform would be able to beat the market.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>But actively managed funds don’t beat the S&amp;P 500 index. “If you look at the median mutual fund, and the S&amp;P index over the last 10, 15 and 20 years, there’s been about a 200 basis points underperformance of the median mutual fund vs. the S&amp;P index,” he said. “If the S&amp;P index were an athlete, they would be testing it for steroids.” Not only that, but there is survivorship bias at work behind the statistics, improving the results of managers. What this refers to is the fact that many funds that didn’t fare well no longer exist and so their performance isn’t incorporated into current statistics.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some fund managers, of course, do beat the index. But the problem is that investors do not know in advance which managers will rise to the top. The 20 best performing funds in the 1970s, which doubled the returns of the S&amp;P 500 index, underperformed the index in the 1980s, noted Malkiel. The 10 best in the 1980s underperformed in the 1990s. Those who managed the best funds in 1998 and 1999, which did three times as well as the S&amp;P 500 index over the same period, were “written up in <em>Money</em> magazine as the genius portfolio managers,” said Malkiel, “and in 2000 and 2001 it was fly now, pay later, because they did three times worse than the index.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>No Free Lunch</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler launched his commentary by pointing out a logical fallacy in the efficient-markets camp. He identified two components of market efficiency. The first, which he calls the No Free Lunch Theorem, simply states that in an efficient market prices aren’t predictable and so it’s not easy to make money. He agreed that this was largely true. The second component, dubbed the Price Is Right Theorem, suggests that asset prices reflect the intrinsic value of the underlying securities and that the prices are therefore rational.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>According to Thaler, Malkiel was making the mistake that many economists make – arguing that the first finding leads logically to the second. Even if prices are unpredictable, said Thaler, “they may be very wrong.” He noted that Bob Schiller, whose book <em>Irrational Exuberance</em> argued forcefully that prices were not rational during the Internet bubble, called the confusion about this “one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although Malkiel acknowledged that bubbles can exist, even in an efficient market, he pointed out that markets always come back down to earth. But in Thaler’s view, this position misses a significant point. In addition to bubbles, there may be stock market “funks” – times when stock prices are irrationally low. “If bubbles break, what makes us think they break to the right level? Do we know that </span><span>Japan</span><span>’s stock prices are rational now?” asked Thaler. “If we’re going to concede that they were irrational in 1989, like [Malkiel] says Internet prices were irrational in 1999, then we also have to grant the possibility that they’re irrationally low now. Stock prices have steadily fallen for over a decade in </span><span>Japan</span><span>. If there was a bubble then, maybe they’re in a funk now.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The idea that prices are rational at any point is up for grabs. To prove his case, Thaler offered examples of companies whose stock prices were, by most lights, incorrect at some point. In 1907 Royal Dutch and Shell Group formed a single company and merged their interests 60/40, but continued to trade as separate stocks. However, the shares of the respective companies didn’t always trade at that ratio, and over the last two decades in particular there were large deviations from their theoretical relationship.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler gave another example. In 1999, 3Com decided to spin off its Palm division, which made handheld computers. 3Com held onto 95% of the shares and announced that each 3Com shareholder would probably get about 1.5 shares of Palm for each share of 3Com. The stocks of the two companies should have moved in tandem, but on the day of the IPO, Palm shot up in value while 3Com lost ground. In other words, what happened wasn’t rational, given the numbers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Malkiel agreed that the 3Com/Palm example was “a $1,000 bill,” adding that he had tried to sell Palm short at the time but was unable to borrow shares. The Royal Dutch/Shell trade, he said, wasn’t as simple an example since the two stocks were under different national regulatory authorities. More broadly, these and other examples of market inefficiencies are “very small examples,” he said, adding that the market “is not a perpetual tulip bulb craze.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Both professors agreed that stock market bubbles eventually deflate but that it’s difficult to predict when that will occur. Similarly, they noted that it’s hard to take advantage of mispricings because it might take too long for prices to return to a more sensible level. Thaler pointed out that Long-Term Capital Management, the Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund that capsized in 1998, had put on the Royal Dutch/Shell trade by going long Shell and shorting Royal Dutch. “But if you’re doing it with other people’s money, like LTCM was, you’ve lost your clients before you’re right,” he said. LTCM was right about Royal Dutch/Shell, but prices didn’t fall back into line until 2001.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The point is not simply that there is often no free lunch. “What we learn is that prices are wrong,” argued Thaler. These examples are the tip of the iceberg of market inefficiency, not just minor blips. “We can argue till the end of our days about whether value firms outperform growth firms, and if so whether that’s rational,” he said. “I don’t think we can argue for long about whether the Royal Dutch and Shell stocks were priced right. If there’s anything the market should be able to get right, it’s these things.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span>The Internet Mistake</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>What troubles Malkiel most as a proponent of efficient markets, he conceded, “is that when the market got it wrong, the market was not giving the right signals to businesses about what the true cost of capital was – and we had an enormous overinvestment in not only Internet companies but the telecommunications structure to make the Internet run.” About 95% of the long-distance fiber is currently unused. “We had a tremendous misallocation of resources,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For Thaler this misallocation of capital is a big iceberg. “The fact that it’s hard to predict prices and that most money managers don’t earn their fees do not tell us anything about whether the capital markets are doing a good or bad job of allocating capital,” he said. “We know there was a $7 trillion mistake in the late 1990s.” He doesn’t think the government or any other entity could do a better job of allocating resources, but that doesn’t mean the market is efficient.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler also pointed out that a consequence of the Internet bubble could be a reduction in the availability of venture capital for a number of years. Siegel weighed in at this point to note that, unlike, say, the railroad bubble of the late 1800s, the Internet bubble involved a lot of people switching jobs but very little destruction of physical capital. “The railroads spent millions of man-years producing iron and cutting through mountains, but with the Internet you didn’t have a lot of [physical] resources, so there wasn’t that [kind of] misallocation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler took another swipe at the idea of efficient markets, floating the idea that the runaway boom in stock options was a consequence of the belief in efficient markets. “This was pushed by economists who felt that markets are sending the right signal through stock prices and that the right way to reward CEOs was to load them up with stock options,” he said. Siegel agreed that there was overissuance of stock options, but noted that tax issues had fueled the trend. In 1993, he said, the government decided that a CEO’s salary in excess of $1 million would not be deductible from the corporate tax bill unless it was deemed incentive-based, and the IRS subsequently ruled that options were incentive-based.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So given the difficulty of predicting stock prices reliably, how does Thaler make investment decisions? Thaler noted that one strategy his money management company follows is to try to predict analyst revisions. “We know people make mistakes,” he said. “We think we can predict their mistakes.” He compared it to baseball. When a sinker-ball pitcher throws a pitch, batters typically swing too high and hit ground balls. “We try to predict the ground balls of analysts,” he explained. “We try to find stocks where we think they’re going to revise up next quarter.” He joked that he didn’t know if the prices were becoming more rational. But, he added, quoting Keynes, “in the long run we’re all dead.”</span></p>

<p>In <em>Spousonomics: Using Economics to Master Love, Marriage, and Dirty Dishes, </em>Paula Szuchman and Jenny Anderson offer an amusing attempt to solve some of love’s stickiest issues by applying the precision of economics to the messiness of relationships.</p>
<p>“At its core, economics is … the study of how people, companies, and societies allocate scarce resources,” Szuchman and Anderson say, “which happens to be the same puzzle you and your spouse are perpetually trying to solve: how to spend your limited time, energy, money, and libido in ways that keep you smiling and your marriage thriving…. The trick is to a) boost those precious resources and b) allocate them more intelligently. Do that, and before you know it, you’ll be on your way to a better return on your marriage.”</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

	</div>
<p>The authors don’t just make things up. Szuchman, a page one editor at <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> and Anderson, a <em>New York Times</em> reporter who spent years covering Wall Street, logged countless hours interviewing economists, psychologists and hundreds of couples coast-to-coast. They thank United Sample for helping them survey roughly 1,000 people nationwide to come up with what they refer to as their “Exhausting, Groundbreaking, and Very Expensive Marriage Survey.” And they clearly did their homework — on everything from Holland’s tulip craze to the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>Whether the book’s insights could save a faltering marriage is up for debate, but it is a fun read. Economists “turned out to be a surprisingly romantic bunch,” the authors write, and they discover that economics offers “dispassionate, logical solutions” to “thorny, illogical, and highly emotional” domestic disputes. “When it was all over, we were convinced: Economics is the surest route to marital bliss.”</p>
<p>To prove it, the authors structure each chapter around a different economic theme and then use case studies to show how various economic principles apply to marriage. Some attempts, such as plotting sex along a supply and demand curve, come off as a bit of a stretch. Other juxtapositions spark fresh insights and might even inspire a practical solution or two. Szuchman and Anderson use division of labor, for example, to take a clear-eyed look at how couples should most effectively divide household chores. They remind us that being loss averse may lead to irrational or unproductive decisions and that trade-offs are part of life — get used to it.</p>
<p>In both language and concept, the book ricochets from economic jargon to down-and-dirty dishing about sex, sometimes struggling to connect the two. Case in point: Do Szuchman and Anderson <em>really</em> believe that sex is “merely a function of supply and demand” and that couples can boost the amount of sex they have by bringing its cost down?</p>
<p>“By the ‘cost’ of sex, we don’t mean the literal cost of <em>paying</em> for sex,” they say. “We mean what it costs you, as in what you have to give up to get it — the fifteen minutes of sleep you’ll miss out on, the emails you won’t have time to reply to, the last-minute run to the supermarket to make sure little Johnny’s lunch is stocked with organic applesauce.” From an economic standpoint, when the cost of sex goes up, the demand for it goes down, they argue. The solution: “Lower the costs. Do that, and the quantity demanded will rise almost instantly.”</p>
<p>Likewise, there is a chapter comparing economic bubbles to new love’s giddy infatuation. In economics, bubbles occur when the price of something rises far above its actual worth. This is exactly what couples do early in their relationship, <em>Spousonomics</em> argues: They over-value each other. They become blind to each other’s faults. They don’t heed warning signs that, in hindsight, should have been obvious.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>Marriage as a Business</strong></p>
<p>Still, even when the analogies are a reach, the unexpected comparisons provide surprising food for thought. In the chapter on bubbles, for example, Szuchman and Anderson offer one economist’s views about how to approach recovery after the bubble bursts. Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that bubbles are necessary for the economy, opening it up to a cycle of “creative destruction” that allows the economy to revitalize itself and become more vibrant and productive. So bubbles are actually a good thing. The same principle could be applied to marriage, the authors argue. Disillusionment is painful, but sometimes a process of death and rebirth is required for a relationship to grow. “In other words, you can’t spackle the holes in the wall and cover them with pictures,” they write. “Sometimes you need to tear the wall down entirely and rebuild it from scratch.”</p>
<p>Occasionally, <em>Spousonomics </em>offers economic insights that not only make sense but might actually help a marriage work better. The chapter on division of labor, for example, points out that couples who divide household chores using the theory of comparative advantage might be better off than those who split duties straight down the middle.</p>
<p>Comparative advantage is the cornerstone of free trade. It says that countries should specialize in whatever good they produce most efficiently and trade for the rest. Marriage can also benefit from such division. “Think of marriage as a business comprising two partners,” the authors write. “You’re not only business partners in the sense that you work together for the good of your company, you’re also trading partners who exchange services, often in the form of household chores. How should you decide who does what?”</p>
<p>For centuries, marriage divided its labor and thrived from specialization, the authors assert. Husbands and wives had very specific roles and a very clear division of duties. But as the economy changed, technology advanced, and women entered the workforce, the balance changed. According to Wharton business and public policy professors <a target="_blank" href="http://bpub.wharton.upenn.edu/people/faculty.cfm?id=713">Betsey Stevenson</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://bpub.wharton.upenn.edu/people/faculty.cfm?id=716">Justin Wolfers</a>, marriage began to shift from “a forum for shared production to shared consumption.”</p>
<p>Of course, that shift has made it difficult to decide who should do the dishes. In one case study, a couple named Eric and Nancy decided it would be fair to divvy up all the housework 50/50. They rotated everything: walking the dog, paying the bills, doing the laundry, cleaning the bathroom. They both did it all — and resented each other as a result. Finally, after the bickering and score-keeping became unbearable, they decided to divvy up the chores based on comparative advantage — and both saved time as a result.</p>
<p>“Like two countries, married people also exchange goods and services, and each also brings to the table a different set of abilities and interests. By figuring out which of them has the comparative advantage in a range of tasks, from dishes to dog walking to bulb planting, Eric and Nancy could then decide who would specialize in what,” Szuchman and Anderson write. “Life need not be a fifty/fifty split for each person to be happy. It could be sixty/forty, or seventy/thirty, or even ninety-nine/one, depending on the people, the situation, and the willingness to put away the calculator and give and take based on what really works best rather than what we think <em>should</em> work best.”</p>
<p>Loss aversion is another economic concept the authors tie successfully to marriage. Economists have found that people act irrationally in the face of loss — even the possibility of loss. In fact, people hate losing more than they love winning, the authors write: According to economists, losing hurts twice as much as winning excites. Look no further than the stock market for proof: The financial press is filled with tales of hapless traders who make risky bets to recoup small losses.</p>
<p>“Here’s the punch line,” Szuchman and Anderson write: “Loss aversion is messing with your marriage. When loss aversion kicks in, you’re liable to stay up all night arguing because you don’t want to lose a fight. You’ll refuse to compromise because it means giving up what you want. You won’t apologize because you don’t want to lose face. And you’ll fail to appreciate the good stuff that’s right in front of your because all you can think about is how much more fun married life <em>used</em> to be.”</p>
<p><strong>Making Trade-Offs</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes people may feel that they are losing something based simply upon how a choice is presented. In an experiment, psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky found that people would make different choices depending upon how a question was asked.</p>
<p>The researchers created a scenario about a disease outbreak that was expected to kill 600 people, and asked test subjects to choose between two plans: Plan A had a 100% chance of saving 200 people; Plan B had a one-third chance of saving 600 lives but a 2/3 chance of saving no one. Seventy-two percent chose Plan A.</p>
<p>Then the researchers offered two new plans: Plan A had a 100% chance that 400 people would die; Plan B had a 1/3 chance of no one dying and 2/3 chance that everyone would die. The plans are exactly the same, but in the second round, 78% of test subjects chose plan B.</p>
<p>“The first presents the options in terms of who lives and the second in terms of who dies — in other words, as potential gains or potential losses. Invariably, subjects gravitated toward the gains,” the authors write. For marriage, the conclusion is clear. “Frame a choice differently and you might change your mind about which path to take. You might also feel more open to compromise. That’s because our willingness to compromise has a lot to do with whether we think we’re losing or whether we see the potential for a gain.”</p>
<p>Reframing one’s perspective on marriage is hard, especially when both parties have invested heavily in their own positions. But again, there is an economic fix. “Economists would argue that fixating on past investments — or what’s known as ‘sunk costs’ — when weighing what to do in the future is a waste of time,” Szuchman and Anderson point out. “Sunk costs are just what they sound like: sunk, buried, kaput, <em>finito.</em> Let them go, a wise economist would say, focus on future costs and benefits, not money you’ve spent and can’t get back.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, both marriage and economics are filled with trade-offs. The classic example is the choice between guns and butter. The more a country spends on national security, in other words, the less it has to spend on goods. Marriage is also a game of trade-offs, and sometimes they aren’t fair.</p>
<p>In one case study, Gus seethes about having to take on all of the housework and parenting duties while his wife Abby goes through medical school. The nine-year haul seemed unfair to Gus, but he stuck it out because he knew that long-term it would pay off. In other words, he managed to think like an economist.</p>
<p>“Economists say that in a market economy, people inevitably face trade-offs between equity — or what’s fair — and efficiency, or the optimal allocation of resources,” the authors write. “The problem with fixating on life’s unfairness is that it precludes our ability to think clearly about trade-offs, which can lead to very inefficient outcomes. The solution: Get over it. Not exactly a high-concept solution, but the only way to tackle inequity aversion is to will it away — to recognize that the more time you spend in an it’s-not-fair mentality, the less time you have to calculate the long-term benefits of a trade-off, for tallying up the short-term costs, and, ultimately, for finding solutions.”</p>

<p><em><span>Neuroeconomics is a burgeoning field of research that is shedding new light on traditional economic models. By utilizing the findings from economics, neuroscience and psychology, experts are gaining new insights into how people make decisions, and about the neural mechanisms in the brain that trigger economic decisions.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>At the University of Pennsylvania, Joseph Kable, assistant professor in the psychology and education departments, is conducting research in neuroeconomics, and considering ways to bring the pioneering approach into the working world.

Neural value signals can help explain these deviations and how decision-making processes differ from individual to individual.</span></em></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><em><span>Professor Kable spoke with Arabic Knowledge@Wharton to explain his work in neuroeconomics and the how the research could apply to a wide range of decision-making processes, from daily buying decisions to the unrest in the Middle East.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>An edited transcript of the conversation follows.</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>What exactly is neuroeconomics?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Joseph Kable:</span></strong> <span>Neuroeconomics is a convergence of two influences. On the one hand, it’s the neuroscientist who wants to understand what is going on in the brain when people and animals make decisions. They’ve come to the realization that to really understand the neural processes, you have to have a framework for understanding decisions at a behavioral level, and that’s going to come from economics, psychology, judgment and decision-making. You have economists, psychologists, and others who are coming to the realization that neural processes are another source of data that could inform their own theorizing and their own modeling about how people make decisions. This could be a new source of tools for testing theories in economics and psychology.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How is the brain used to analyze decision-making?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>One thing is that the neural mechanisms become another place to test extensions of your theories. One example from my own work is trying to understand how people make decisions about time, and why people aren’t patient. They want good things to happen sooner and they don’t want to wait around for them. There’s a lot of thinking trying to explain that we fundamentally think about immediate rewards and delayed rewards, using two different mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span>There are other explanations about the phenomenon, which posits, that there’s no categorical boundary between now and not now. One of the things that I did with Professor Paul Glimcher [head of the Center for Neural Science at New York University] was that we tested whether the neural response [involved] when you’re making decisions on whether [wanting] something now versus [wanting] everything later was categorically different and we found that it wasn’t. We think that counts as evidence in explaining why people who are more patient are going to do better [in life].</span></p>
<p><span>Let me see if I can give you another example that works on the same principle: There are a lot of people who work in marketing who want to ask questions about people’s relationship to brands. The assumption is people relate to brands exactly as people relate to people. For example, Coke is a friend of yours, or that Burger King is a naughty little boy. That’s not how people think about brands. The work of a colleague of mine, Carolyn Yoon, associate professor of marketing at the University of Michigan, suggests that when you ask people to make judgments about brands or you ask people to make judgments about people, you’re getting completely different neural networks. You can force people to think in that way but that’s not a natural way people think about brands.</span></p>
<p><span>So if you want to study their perceptions of brands, you might want to move in the direction that doesn’t assume that people think about brands in the same way they think about people.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Can you give other examples of how neuroeconomics can be applied to real-world business issues?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>In the work of another colleague of mine, knowing a little bit about the brain can lead you to make new and somewhat counterintuitive decisions when you’re designing products. This is the work of Charles Spence, professor of experimental psychology and head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University.</span></p>
<p><span>Nowadays, luxury car companies have all those advanced systems, such as how the car can tell where the driver is looking, where the car is going. The question is, if you’re getting input that the car is headed to a ditch, and you can tell the driver is not looking at the road, how are you going to tell them to look at the road? I think most people’s intuition is telling them to put a really big red light on the dashboard and flash, ‘Look at the road, look at the road!’</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><span>Charles knows about sensory neuroscience and knew about a striking finding, that if you stimulate a certain part of the brain, it elicits a very automatic defense mechanism. And the interesting thing about this part of the brain is it’s the part of the brain that processes noises that are close to you and right behind your head. On the basis of this, he figured out something that might be considered counterintuitive. The thing that works the best is you put an alarm behind the driver’s head.</span></p>
<p><span>So he tested this [theory] out — whether the big, red light in front of the driver or the noise right behind him would work better. He found the noise behind them would work better as an alarm system.</span></p>
<p><span>I think that’s another example of the interplay between neuroscience and marketing at work with productive findings. This wasn’t a neuroscience study. Professor Spence wasn’t putting people on an MRI scanner. He was just aware of the development in sensory science, and that motivated a behavioral prediction that he went out and confirmed. In a lot of cases, behavioral predictions are not necessarily important in the applied domain, but in this case, the behavioral prediction was very much [pertinent] in the applied domain. In this case, how do you design a product that’s going to work the best?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Looking at some of the turmoil in the Middle East, </span><span>the economic situation has been the way it is for years. So, what was the tipping point? What made people do what they did in Tunisia or Egypt at this point? Can neuroeconomics explain some of this?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>I do think there are some relevant factors that we know about from studying decision-making. Why is there a tipping point? Well, one factor is that protesters are likely engaged in what economists call a ‘coordination game.’ If everyone takes to the streets, the likelihood of success is great. But if there isn’t a critical mass, the likelihood of success is much lower, and putting yourself on the line is much more dangerous than staying home. So each individual’s decision hinges critically on what they expect other people will do. Once there are enough people who expect — or see with their own eyes — that others are ‘in,’ the calculus changes, and it can change very quickly.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>What kind of research is your center doing?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>A lot of my work is on patience and impulsivity; how people generally prefer to have good things happen sooner rather than later. And the current work I’m doing is really looking at two directions.</span></p>
<p><span>One understands what changes in the brain when people’s degree of impulsivity changes. We have people make a financial decision about a task in the future. So we give people financial advice, like how to calculate interest rates, how to think about interest rates, how to compare the options they’ve been given in this experiment to other options they already know about because they’ve already had access to them outside of a psychology experiment. And we can find what leads people to be more patient with regard to the future.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s been a lot of work about biases and how that affects decision-making. Or how nudges in decision-making can be used to push people in one direction or another. You can change how a question is framed and that can subtly lead people to be more or less patient.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How seriously do people’s choices deviate from rational choice theory?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>I am of the opinion that people deviate much less than you might expect, given the popular and academic characterizations of people being riddled with biases and irrationalities. But I also think that as we study them, they reveal that people’s minds are rationally maximizing something, just not what experimenters had expected or predicted. One example of this that we’re looking at is failures of "self-control." When people give up on a difficult task (from solving puzzles in the lab, to sticking to a diet outside the lab), it’s often seen as weakness. And when you’ve already sunk time and effort into it, it’s sometimes seen as irrational — why didn’t you just not try in the first place? But these analyses ignore the opportunity costs of your time and mental efforts. You could be applying your focus to more valuable activities. Instead of solving the experimenter’s puzzles, you could think about your homework assignments. Instead of worrying about what to eat, you could work on exercising more. And if the first activity isn’t paying dividends, it makes total sense to move on. In that light, these ‘failures’ stop looking so much like failure.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How does decision making differ across individuals, and what are the sources — psychological, genetic, and neural — of such individual differences?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>There are many examples, but one I’ve studied is individual differences in how people make decisions about the future. We can ask people whether they’d prefer to have a smaller amount of money immediately or a larger amount of money at some future point in time. They differ extraordinarily on their answers. Some people are extremely patient. They say, for example, that they’d prefer US$21 in three months to US$20 today. Others are extremely impatient. They say that they’d take the US$20 now rather than wait three months for US$120. And anecdotally, these differences are related to differences in people’s personality and behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>The most patient person I studied was a medical resident who came in for the experiment on their one day off each month. The most impatient person sent me cool pictures of the time they went skydiving.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve shown that these differences are related to how the striatum and prefrontal cortex are active when these individuals make these decisions. The parts of those regions that encode how valuable an option is to you are very active for small, delayed rewards in patient people, and not so active, in the same case, for impatient people. Since these regions get prominent inputs from dopamine neurons, it would make sense if these activation differences were associated with genetic differences in the dopamine system, and now there’s growing evidence that this is the case. Both these brain regions and dopamines have been implicated in impulsivity generally (e.g. "acting without thinking"), but we’ve shown in our lab that the impatience we measure in decision-making tasks is fundamentally different from those other kinds of impulsivity. There’s almost no relation between the two measures.</span></p>
<p><span>We do see a correlation between the people willing to wait in a task and measures of academic ability or academic performance. We do also see being very impatient, in respect to the future, [can lead to] lots of bad health outcomes. Being very impatient is associated with drug use, obesity, problem gambling, alcoholism, and a whole range of bad life outcomes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>You mentioned studying the mechanisms underlying changes in people’s preferences. Is that through MRI?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>In the same decision-making task (US$20 today versus US$120 in a month), we’ve shown that people become more patient and more willing to wait for the delayed reward after learning some basic information about finance (e.g. how to calculate the implied interest rate in the tradeoff presented). One question you might ask is: Are they learning to ‘like’ the delayed reward more, or are they learning to choose delayed rewards even though they don’t ‘like’ them? We think the patterns of brain activity when they choose the delayed reward after learning will inform the answer to this question. We’ve shown before that the patterns of brain activity in striatum and prefrontal cortex reflect what reward is most valuable to the person, and are different for patient and impatient people.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Is that the same MRI machine used to check for concussions? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>It’s the same technology. But what is a recent development is the technique — the way of running the MRI that allows you to measure neural activity with good facial and temporal positions. Before that, there were other techniques used for measuring human brain function. We had other functional imaging techniques, but certainly, I think part of the reason why neuroeconomics took off so much was [the fact that] MRI technology became widely available. Before that, the tests were more expensive so fewer people had access to them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Would the principles of immediate gratification versus delayed gratification get affected in emerging market societies?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>Certainly one thing that is critically important to the question of immediate versus delayed gratification is uncertainty. Emerging markets, terrorism, poverty, etc. would all contribute to uncertainty. Let me give you an example of an emerging market facing extreme poverty: South Africa. A colleague of mine ran the same experiments in poor areas of South Africa that I’d run in the U.S. with college students, asking them whether they would prefer a smaller amount of money now or a larger amount of money later. He found a much greater degree of impatience in South Africa, compared to the U.S. — so much so that we cannot use the same questions in the two countries (i.e., most South Africans would take all of the money now, given the same questions we used in the U.S.). And much of this makes sense given the uncertainty there. If you’re not sure what your conditions will be in the future, or whether you’ll even still be around, why wait?</span></p>
<p><span>One point this makes clearly is that in making decisions about delayed gratification, your expectations about the future are key. We’re currently using fMRI to look at how these expectations are represented in the brain, and how experience or new learning updates them. You can imagine how, if everyone suddenly perceives lots more uncertainty all at once, the shift towards immediate concerns could wreak havoc on an economy. We’re interested in understanding the neural processes that underlie such shift in perceptions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How did the field of neuroeconomics first develop?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>You had a couple of neuroscientists reaching out to economists. And you had a couple of people in behavioral economics, and psychology in economics, who were excited by the rise of cognitive neurosciences and all these methods for understanding how human brain works. They were starting to reach out to neuroscientists. In the early days, there were special conferences that were quite small, which brought together a small group of people from both sides. After those meetings went on for three to five years, more people became interested in the subject and more people got involved. Instead of people from two different fields talking to each other, it really started to develop into a field of its own. And now there’s a Society of Neuroeconomics and annual conferences in neuroeconomics.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s been a parallel development both in the U.S. and in Europe. The early conferences were in the U.S. but nowadays one of the most successful labs is in Zurich. There’s also a growing community in Asia, primarily in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and China.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How long has neuroeconomics been a field of research?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kable:</span></strong> <span>There’s been some debate about when exactly it started. I think clearly it was about the turn of the century, or maybe a little after that when the discussion really get started. I would say that in the last five years things have taken off exponentially. Part of [the reason for] that is the functional MRI, which is the workhorse technique for looking at human brain function. It only came in wide use in the mid-90s. By the year 2000, most institutions would have ready access to that technology. So that is one precursor that has helped make neuroeconomics [so thriving today].</span></p>
<p><span>One thing that I would add is that this is a very exciting field, and also a very new field. We don’t want to get too excited that neuroeconomics holds all the answers. Lots of smart people have been working on economics and judgment, as well as decision-making in business for a long time. This one tool won’t unlock all the doors. The flip side is not dialing down expectations, not that it’s useless. It’s very useful. Even though we’re early on in the game, its utility will only grow as we gain a more sophisticated understanding of neural mechanism in decision-making.</span></p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2002/10/651_0.jpg" alt=""></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In early October, Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for their research, conducted independently, into how individuals make economic decisions. The two professors discovered that investors are not systematically rational, as traditional economic theory asserts (much of Kahneman’s research, it should be noted, was conducted with his longtime collaborator, the late Amos Tversky). Investors make decisions for emotional reasons, they base their decisions on shaky premises, they are quick to see cause and effect where there may be none, and so on. The professors’ research provided an impetus, respectively, to the burgeoning fields of behavioral finance and experimental economics.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>So what does this mean for the markets? Since the stock market is based on the cumulative decisions of individuals, does this suggest that the market isn’t efficient at determining the correct prices of stocks? Do arbitrage opportunities abound?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>A few days before Kahneman and Smith got their phone calls from the Nobel Prize committee, Wharton hosted a debate that addressed these questions. Called “Two Views of Market Efficiency: A Discussion of Behavioral Finance and Efficient Market Theory,” the scrimmage took place between Burton Malkiel and Richard Thaler, and was moderated by Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeremysiegel.com/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a>, author of <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i>.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Malkiel, a </span><span>Princeton</span><span> </span><span>University</span><span> finance professor and author of the famed <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street, </i>represented the efficient-markets camp. This group argues that the market is a mechanism that utilizes the collective information of stock market participants to produce efficient prices, and that there is no easy money – fresh $100 bills lying on the ground – for investors to make by predicting how stocks will behave. In other words, it’s hard to consistently beat the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler, a finance professor at the </span><span>University</span><span> of </span><span>Chicago</span><span> and a principal at Fuller &amp; Thaler Asset Management, a money management firm based in </span><span>San Mateo</span><span>, </span><span>Calif.</span><span>, took up the cudgels for the behavioral finance camp. He reflected the view that psychology plays a large role in the movement of stock prices and that patterns, or predictabilities, exist in the market that can be profitably arbitraged.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Both professors staked out common ground – at least initially. The market is not so rational that patterns in stock prices can’t be discerned, observed Malkiel. He admitted that psychological factors affect the stock market and that markets overshoot, creating bubbles such as the Internet technology craze of the late 1990s that lifted stock prices to untenable levels.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>However, he said, “none of the patterns that have been discovered have been dependable, many have self-destructed as soon as they have been discovered, and many aren’t economically meaningful.” The patterns that endure are often too small to take advantage of, given the transactions costs associated with the trades. Or the trades are too risky. “I truly believe that our capital markets are remarkably efficient,” he continued. “The stock market is far less predictable than many of my academic colleagues have asserted. While the market is not statistically a perfect random walk, in my judgment investors would be very well-advised to act as if it was essentially unpredictable.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler also claimed what he described as the “sensible” middle ground. “Securities prices are highly correlated with intrinsic value, but sometimes diverge to a significant degree,” he said. “It’s possible to predict stock prices, but not with great precision – and don’t try this at home.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>That said, the two professors pursued their separate views of the market.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Malkiel gave a few examples of alleged predictabilities that, he said, on closer reflection don’t hold up. One is the popular suggestion that growth stocks perform better over the long haul than value stocks. Even if it were true for a period, he said, there could be two explanations. One is the behavioralist explanation, which is that investors are overconfident in their ability to predict growth stocks and therefore overprice growth stocks. The other is the belief that efficient-market proponents hold – that if there’s a pattern for some time, it could be because the value stocks are actually riskier. In other examples, Malkiel noted that patterns in stock prices that get chalked up to investors being exuberant or pessimistic could simply be the adjustment of stock prices to economic conditions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>For those in the efficient-market camp, however, the most convincing proof of the efficiency of the market is the fact that professional portfolio managers cannot consistently outperform the market. “Surely,” said Malkiel, “if the market were always dominated by irrational investors, if it systematically deviated from what were rational estimates of value, professionals who are richly incentivized to outperform would be able to beat the market.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>But actively managed funds don’t beat the S&amp;P 500 index. “If you look at the median mutual fund, and the S&amp;P index over the last 10, 15 and 20 years, there’s been about a 200 basis points underperformance of the median mutual fund vs. the S&amp;P index,” he said. “If the S&amp;P index were an athlete, they would be testing it for steroids.” Not only that, but there is survivorship bias at work behind the statistics, improving the results of managers. What this refers to is the fact that many funds that didn’t fare well no longer exist and so their performance isn’t incorporated into current statistics.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some fund managers, of course, do beat the index. But the problem is that investors do not know in advance which managers will rise to the top. The 20 best performing funds in the 1970s, which doubled the returns of the S&amp;P 500 index, underperformed the index in the 1980s, noted Malkiel. The 10 best in the 1980s underperformed in the 1990s. Those who managed the best funds in 1998 and 1999, which did three times as well as the S&amp;P 500 index over the same period, were “written up in <i>Money</i> magazine as the genius portfolio managers,” said Malkiel, “and in 2000 and 2001 it was fly now, pay later, because they did three times worse than the index.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>No Free Lunch</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler launched his commentary by pointing out a logical fallacy in the efficient-markets camp. He identified two components of market efficiency. The first, which he calls the No Free Lunch Theorem, simply states that in an efficient market prices aren’t predictable and so it’s not easy to make money. He agreed that this was largely true. The second component, dubbed the Price Is Right Theorem, suggests that asset prices reflect the intrinsic value of the underlying securities and that the prices are therefore rational.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>According to Thaler, Malkiel was making the mistake that many economists make – arguing that the first finding leads logically to the second. Even if prices are unpredictable, said Thaler, “they may be very wrong.” He noted that Bob Schiller, whose book <i>Irrational Exuberance</i> argued forcefully that prices were not rational during the Internet bubble, called the confusion about this “one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although Malkiel acknowledged that bubbles can exist, even in an efficient market, he pointed out that markets always come back down to earth. But in Thaler’s view, this position misses a significant point. In addition to bubbles, there may be stock market “funks” – times when stock prices are irrationally low. “If bubbles break, what makes us think they break to the right level? Do we know that </span><span>Japan</span><span>’s stock prices are rational now?” asked Thaler. “If we’re going to concede that they were irrational in 1989, like [Malkiel] says Internet prices were irrational in 1999, then we also have to grant the possibility that they’re irrationally low now. Stock prices have steadily fallen for over a decade in </span><span>Japan</span><span>. If there was a bubble then, maybe they’re in a funk now.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The idea that prices are rational at any point is up for grabs. To prove his case, Thaler offered examples of companies whose stock prices were, by most lights, incorrect at some point. In 1907 Royal Dutch and Shell Group formed a single company and merged their interests 60/40, but continued to trade as separate stocks. However, the shares of the respective companies didn’t always trade at that ratio, and over the last two decades in particular there were large deviations from their theoretical relationship.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler gave another example. In 1999, 3Com decided to spin off its Palm division, which made handheld computers. 3Com held onto 95% of the shares and announced that each 3Com shareholder would probably get about 1.5 shares of Palm for each share of 3Com. The stocks of the two companies should have moved in tandem, but on the day of the IPO, Palm shot up in value while 3Com lost ground. In other words, what happened wasn’t rational, given the numbers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Malkiel agreed that the 3Com/Palm example was “a $1,000 bill,” adding that he had tried to sell Palm short at the time but was unable to borrow shares. The Royal Dutch/Shell trade, he said, wasn’t as simple an example since the two stocks were under different national regulatory authorities. More broadly, these and other examples of market inefficiencies are “very small examples,” he said, adding that the market “is not a perpetual tulip bulb craze.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Both professors agreed that stock market bubbles eventually deflate but that it’s difficult to predict when that will occur. Similarly, they noted that it’s hard to take advantage of mispricings because it might take too long for prices to return to a more sensible level. Thaler pointed out that Long-Term Capital Management, the Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund that capsized in 1998, had put on the Royal Dutch/Shell trade by going long Shell and shorting Royal Dutch. “But if you’re doing it with other people’s money, like LTCM was, you’ve lost your clients before you’re right,” he said. LTCM was right about Royal Dutch/Shell, but prices didn’t fall back into line until 2001.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The point is not simply that there is often no free lunch. “What we learn is that prices are wrong,” argued Thaler. These examples are the tip of the iceberg of market inefficiency, not just minor blips. “We can argue till the end of our days about whether value firms outperform growth firms, and if so whether that’s rational,” he said. “I don’t think we can argue for long about whether the Royal Dutch and Shell stocks were priced right. If there’s anything the market should be able to get right, it’s these things.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>The Internet Mistake</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>What troubles Malkiel most as a proponent of efficient markets, he conceded, “is that when the market got it wrong, the market was not giving the right signals to businesses about what the true cost of capital was – and we had an enormous overinvestment in not only Internet companies but the telecommunications structure to make the Internet run.” About 95% of the long-distance fiber is currently unused. “We had a tremendous misallocation of resources,” he said.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>For Thaler this misallocation of capital is a big iceberg. “The fact that it’s hard to predict prices and that most money managers don’t earn their fees do not tell us anything about whether the capital markets are doing a good or bad job of allocating capital,” he said. “We know there was a $7 trillion mistake in the late 1990s.” He doesn’t think the government or any other entity could do a better job of allocating resources, but that doesn’t mean the market is efficient.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler also pointed out that a consequence of the Internet bubble could be a reduction in the availability of venture capital for a number of years. Siegel weighed in at this point to note that, unlike, say, the railroad bubble of the late 1800s, the Internet bubble involved a lot of people switching jobs but very little destruction of physical capital. “The railroads spent millions of man-years producing iron and cutting through mountains, but with the Internet you didn’t have a lot of [physical] resources, so there wasn’t that [kind of] misallocation,” he said.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thaler took another swipe at the idea of efficient markets, floating the idea that the runaway boom in stock options was a consequence of the belief in efficient markets. “This was pushed by economists who felt that markets are sending the right signal through stock prices and that the right way to reward CEOs was to load them up with stock options,” he said. Siegel agreed that there was overissuance of stock options, but noted that tax issues had fueled the trend. In 1993, he said, the government decided that a CEO’s salary in excess of $1 million would not be deductible from the corporate tax bill unless it was deemed incentive-based, and the IRS subsequently ruled that options were incentive-based.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>So given the difficulty of predicting stock prices reliably, how does Thaler make investment decisions? Thaler noted that one strategy his money management company follows is to try to predict analyst revisions. “We know people make mistakes,” he said. “We think we can predict their mistakes.” He compared it to baseball. When a sinker-ball pitcher throws a pitch, batters typically swing too high and hit ground balls. “We try to predict the ground balls of analysts,” he explained. “We try to find stocks where we think they’re going to revise up next quarter.” He joked that he didn’t know if the prices were becoming more rational. But, he added, quoting Keynes, “in the long run we’re all dead.”</span></p><p> </p>

<p><em>“Why would a man in Morocco who doesn’t have enough to eat buy a television? Why is it hard for children in poor areas to learn, even when they attend school? Why do the poorest people in the Indian state of Maharashtra spend seven percent of their food budget on sugar?” Such are the questions that MIT economists Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo seek to investigate in their research, according to the website of their book, </em>Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty<em>. </em></p>
<p><em>What makes Banerjee’s and Duflo’s approach radical? The reason is that, unlike other economists who focus on macro issues such as aid, they approach poverty much as medical researchers might set about finding the treatment for a disease — by conducting clinical trials. Duflo, who <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/esther_duflo_social_experiments_to_fight_poverty.html"><em><span>delivered a TED talk</span></em></a> on this theme in February 2010, explained that the effects of aid are often hard to measure, but it is “possible to know which development efforts help and which hurt — by testing solutions with randomized trials.” Their method involves putting social initiatives to the same rigorous scientific tests that medical researchers use for drugs. This takes the guesswork out of policy-making, according to Duflo, by showing “what works, what doesn’t work and why.” There are no miracle cures, but specific steps — such as providing food as an incentive for immunization or providing subsidized bed nets to reduce malaria — can end up having a massive impact on efforts to reduce poverty, the authors note.</em></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><em>Banerjee and Duflo never expected </em>Poor Economics<em> to make for good business. “We wonder how our book is a business book,” says Duflo. But the attention their book has received has now been capped by the 2011 </em>Financial Times<em> Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award. Banerjee and Duflo were at a conference in Goa, India, last week. After their presentation, the authors sat down with Knowledge@Wharton to explain their concepts and how they can be used to end global poverty. </em></p>
<p><em>An edited version of the transcript follows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How does it feel to win the book award?</p>
<p><strong>Esther Duflo:</strong> We are certainly happy but at the same time baffled. We wonder how our book [can be considered] a business book since it is about finding and thinking of ways to end global poverty. Nonetheless, we are happy that some businesses and businessmen are interested in our work.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What, in your view, is the best way to tackle poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Abhijit Banerjee:</strong> The central point of our book is that there isn’t a single answer, that the question itself is wrong. There is no single action that is going to solve the problem of poverty. There are perhaps a few hundred steps that we need to take, each of which will do something, as long as we take the right steps. There is no evidence that we could adopt one step that is far more important than the others. I think that the one-size-fits-all recipe for tackling poverty is an illusion. It is a convenient illusion, so that you can believe that you can solve the problem with a single step. But this does not seem to be supported by data.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> But surely of those hundreds of steps, there must be some crucial ones that come to mind when you talk of eliminating poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> Yes, there are some crucial steps. I can’t say they are the most important but these, as we know today, are very effective. However, that is not to say that in the future there will not be other steps which would be even more effective.</p>
<p>According to our current state of knowledge, there is a zone of shadow where we are not sure exactly what to do. But there are some things we do know that work across sectors. Educating children, for example, is one of them — imparting quality education to them right from a young age. Similarly, there could be positive social and political impact of health care for the poor, which includes steps like better access to preventive health [and] finding ways to put iron, vitamins, etc., in the food that poor people consume, which we know will be good from a medical point of view. Giving an asset — like a cow — to extremely poor people, and then some help in taking care of that asset, also works. These, we feel, are some of the effective steps that can be taken in the initiative towards ending poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton: </strong>In your presentation at the Goa conference, you emphasized the quality of education, quality of curriculum, etc. In the case of the poor, where educating children is often seen as the only passport to escape poverty, does the quality of education matter?</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> Yes, that is absolutely crucial. If you don’t learn to read or acquire basic math skills by the time you are 13 or 14 — and there is a significant portion of students with this deficiency — then the entire effort is worthless. It is a crime that children should be subjected to such education. No one is talking to them, the whole class is going on and they do not understand a thing. There is nothing worse than this. I don’t believe we are giving children a decent chance to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> [While] it is not good to say that no education is better than some education, an education that is so blatantly ignorant and irrelevant is a torture. </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How do you define poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> There is no one way to define poverty that is going to satisfy everyone. You have to make an arbitrary call as to what you think poverty is, and when you make that call, you should decide what you are trying to capture. If you are trying to capture a set of people who are so desperate that they need immediate help, that is one thing. If you want to say what is an unacceptable level of standard of living, and the country needs to somehow fix that problem, then that is a different thing. There is no definition that is independent of the question you have posed. If the policy question is, ‘How do I target emergency help?’, then that is one definition. It would be very different if you were to decide to set the target for, say, the next 15 years. Our poverty line for the desperately poor should be much lower than our goal that you will provide everyone at least ‘X’ after 15 years. It depends upon what policy question we are trying to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In India, poverty has always been a top-of-mind issue. Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize for his work on poverty. C.K. Prahalad became famous for <em>The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid</em>. Would you agree that poverty in India is a lucrative opportunity area?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> At a basic level, there are lots of poor people, and so they are a market. There are some forms of social businesses that have done well in this regard, and they are there for us to see. A lot of people inspired by C.K. Prahalad say that you can make money while helping the poor. However, you have to be a little more careful. I am not saying that these opportunities don’t exist. Sometimes it is true that there is a market and someone can come and creatively tap it. But there are also lots of things that the poor need and the market is not able to provide them. It is a big mistake to think that markets will be able to do everything. This notion is misguided. </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: The Indian Planning Commission has set the poverty line at 65 cents a day. You have different views on this and on what parameters poverty should be measured. Would you briefly explain that? </p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> Let’s not use [the conversion to U.S. cents]; it is very misleading. Let’s say Rs. 32, and let’s be very clear about what that means. The problem with that conversion is that it doesn’t allow for differences in prices. The latest conversion between the rupee and dollar that allows for differences in prices is roughly Rs. 19 to a U.S. dollar. That is the right conversion, not Rs. 48 or Rs. 49 to a dollar [the current exchange rate]. This is what the World Bank uses in PPP [Purchasing Power Parity] estimates. So, under this conversion, Rs. 32 is $1.70. That’s the right number, not 65 cents a day. For any of these questions [about poverty], the market dollar rate is not relevant. You take a bus ride here, it costs Rs. 3. In the U.S., it would cost $2. You have to adjust for the fact that things are cheaper in India than in the U.S. If you don’t do that, you get a completely misleading number. </p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> We are not deeply interested in measuring poverty. Others do it. People in the World Bank do it, and they put in lots of effort at measuring poverty levels. India itself has a long tradition of doing that very well. At the end of the day, what is important is not to measure poverty as much as try to understand what to do about it. In some sense, it is a democratic debate in which all people should have something to say.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> The poor, you say, are more discerning customers than the rich because they have to make a little go a much longer way. But do the government, aid workers, companies, etc., make any effort to provide choice? </p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> It’s a good question. I think lots of aid policy and, in general, the social policy ignores the free will of the poor. They are seen as sort of desperate — you give them this and they are going to take it. The poor, on the other hand, are trying to have a good life within the constraints they face. And if you tell them to have a particular kind of food every day just because it is healthy food — for instance, eat chickpeas everyday — they are not going to do it. So you have to dig out their reality as to how they want to live their lives. We often tell them to boil water for 20 minutes but we don’t take the reality of their lives [into consideration]. Twenty minutes is a lot of time for a woman who has to do so many things in the house. You have to think of what the priorities are. You tell them to do things and then wonder why they are not doing them. They are not doing them because you have not understood their lives very well. You have to give them choices and understand their choice behavior. If you really want to do something for them, you have to make it attractive enough for them to do it. You can’t think of the poor as machines. </p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Is the problem of global poverty too huge to envision and address? </p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> We need to cut this huge problem into many problems, problems that can be dealt with one by one. Some people term it as one huge problem and then conclude that there is one big solution to it. Projected this way, people get depressed by the enormity of the problem. The right thing is to say that it is not one giant problem, but a series of issues that need to be addressed in numerous ways. This way, there will be incremental victories and progress towards ending poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You say that the three villains of efforts to eradicate poverty are ideology, ignorance and inertia. And the three problem interfaces are the expert, the aid worker and the local policy maker. In rural India, it is the local government and the aid worker who are regarded as the biggest hurdles. What is your experience of other countries?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> Essentially, there is not much aid coming to India, and hence you cannot blame the aid workers. India gets very little aid, and most of the money on anti-poverty programs is spent by the government. So, there is no large presence of aid workers in India, but there are many good NGOs [non-governmental organizations] in India who are doing excellent work. There is a lot of difference between the places where policies are being designed, say in New Delhi, and people in the field. These field workers are doing good work, and they have a much better sense of what is actually going on at the field level. Their knowledge is not necessarily being harnessed. There are countries — in Africa, for example — which receive lots of aid, but essentially face the same issues.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Do anti-poverty campaigns receive enough money? Is there adequate funding for projects such as yours?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> No. There is a lot more money that could be spent. And even within what is being spent, little money goes into supporting innovative programs that can be carefully tested, carefully identified and carefully implemented. Too much money and governmental resources are spent on programs that have not been tested. Rather than spending it carefully, too much is spent on [the] wrong programs. There is too little money going into anti-poverty programs that we would like to see.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What has your Poverty Action Lab (the Abdul Latif Jamil Poverty Action Lab or J-PAL) accomplished so far?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> In 2003, we founded the Poverty Action Lab to encourage and support research on a new way of doing economics, based on what we call randomized control trials. These give researchers, working with local partners, a chance to implement large-scale experiments designed to test their theories. As of 2010, J-PAL researchers had completed or were engaged in 240 experiments across 40 countries. A very large number of organizations, researchers and policy makers have embraced the idea of randomized trials. Many have come to share our basic premise — it is possible to make very significant progress against the biggest problems in the world through a set of small steps, each well thought-out, carefully tested and judiciously implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How do you think the Occupy protest movement, that started on Wall Street and has spread globally, will impact the ongoing debate on global poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> At the moment, the Occupy Wall Street protest is very much in response to domestic issues in the U.S., to the increasing inequalities in the U.S. in the past 10 to 15 years, to inertia and to the inadequate response to the economic crisis in the U.S. Global poverty is not at the forefront of their consideration at this point in time. So I frankly don’t know whether or not this protest is going to have any impact on how to think about solving the problem of global poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> There is a general worry that it will lead to an irresponsible, populist backlash in policymaking in the West, like anti-trade and all that. It could turn into something like the Tea Party. And that will be bad. But right now, they are just reacting to what is the real problem in all the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries. In some of these countries, there is ballooning inequality, and there is very little official response to tackle this.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Recent studies have shown that poverty has increased dramatically in the U.S. over the past decade, due in part to the economic downturn. In a world of continuing global financial uncertainty, what challenges do we face in fighting global poverty?</p>
<p><strong>Banerjee:</strong> Slowing growth in the West is a huge problem for growing countries like India, China, Bangladesh and Pakistan, which rely on servicing these markets. They are all going to face some constraints on that account. It is also clear that there is a certain amount of policy attention or creativity that is now being directed to finding the equilibrium within [Western] economies. After all, we need talent from the whole world to think about ways of ending poverty. </p>
<p><strong>Duflo:</strong> The crises in the end have to affect the lives of the very poor. The immediate impact of the global financial crisis was not as harsh on the very poor as on the middle classes of the rich countries. What is more worrisome is the inability to get out of the crisis in the past few years. That eventually will create additional challenges, particularly for the people in the developing world.</p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2002/08/605_0.jpg" alt=""></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>Joseph E. Stiglitz is a Nobel-winning professor of economics at </span><span>Columbia</span><span>, a former World Bank chief economist and former chairman of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors. But if he had not specialized in the dismal science, he likely would have been a muckraking journalist in the style of Westbrook Pegler, the controversial mid-20<sup>th</sup> century newspaper columnist. At least that is one impression a reader may take away upon finishing Stiglitz’s new book, <i>Globalization and Its Discontents.</i> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>To be sure, some significant differences do exist between the men. For example, while Pegler turned his sights on such disparate targets as the Supreme Court and the Newspaper Guild, Stiglitz primarily limits his critique to the International Monetary Fund – and to a lesser degree, the World Bank – and their influence, for better or worse, on the process of globalization. </span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>It is a timely book, issued in a period when </span><span>protests against the process of globalization continue to spread across the globe, and </span><span>Stiglitz musters some impressive ammunition for his indictment of the IMF. But like the people who take to the streets against GATT, NAFTA and other trade-friendly policies, the volume of his salvo may mask some gaps in his reasoning.</span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>“I believe that globalization – the removal of barriers to free trade and the closer integration of national economies – can be a force for good and that it has the potential to enrich everyone in the world, particularly the poor,” Stiglitz writes in his preface. “But I also believe that if this is to be the case, the way globalization has been managed…need(s) to be radically rethought.”</span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>Stiglitz says that the IMF, which adopted a commitment to capitalism during the Reagan-Thatcher era, is the culprit behind global mismanagement. “The IMF and the World Bank became the new missionary institutions, through which these ideas were pushed on the reluctant poor countries that often badly needed their loans and grants,” he writes. “Western banks benefited from the loosening of capital market controls in Latin America and Asia, but those regions suffered when inflows of speculative hot money … suddenly reversed.”</span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>Stiglitz sees the invisible hand of the IMF behind almost every crisis, from the collapse of the post-communist Russian economy to the East Asian crisis that began when the Thai <i>baht </i>collapsed in July 1997. He says the common denominator among these and other implosions has been the IMF’s demand for fiscal austerity, privatization, and market liberalization.</span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span>In </span><span>Russia</span><span>, for example, Stiglitz points out that when most price controls were lifted virtually overnight in 1992, a period of hyperinflation was ushered in. The antidote, according to the IMF, was to tighten monetary policy through interest rate hikes. But Stiglitz says the liberalization and stabilization policies pushed by the IMF actually worked against the strategy of privatization as investment halted, savings evaporated due to inflation, and privatization led to asset stripping. Oligarchs with political connections, for example, were able to garner former state-owned assets for pennies on the dollar.</span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>The problems in </span><span>Russia</span><span> were exacerbated in 1998 when the East Asian crisis depressed demand for oil and crude prices fell, robbing </span><span>Russia</span><span> of an important source of income. In Stiglitz’s view, the East Asian meltdown can be traced to currency speculators who took advantage of the region’s liberalized financial markets. Of course, those markets were opened in response to pressure from the IMF.</span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>“If the crises had a familiar pattern, so too did the IMF’s responses: It provided huge amounts of money (the total bailout packages, including support from G-7 countries, was $95 billion) so the countries could sustain the exchange rate,” writes Stiglitz. “The money served another function: It enabled the countries to provide dollars to the firms that had borrowed from Western bankers to repay the loans.”</span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span> </span></p><p class="DefinitionList"><span>Stiglitz may say that the crises have a familiar pattern, but so do his explanations, which consist of a connect-the-dots approach that consistently points to the IMF’s free-market policies as a disrupting force, while virtually ignoring other causes. In his analysis of the East Asian crises, for example, Stiglitz plays down the destructive role of collusive government-business ties, particularly those involving the <i>chaebol</i>, or inter-networked conglomerates, and the banks. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="2"> </font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span>In one telling statement, Stiglitz claims that </span><span>South Korea</span><span> “ignored outside advice and re-capitalized its two largest banks rather than closing them down. This is part of why </span><span>Korea</span><span> recovered relatively quickly.” But in a May 2002 interview with <i>Business Week</i>, Korean President Kim Dae Jung (who was in office during the 1998 crisis) notes that the country’s turnaround involved “ … a lot of pain. Some 600 of 2,100 financial institutions were shuttered, and 16 of the 30 largest <i>chaebol</i> were either broken up or are under new ownership.”</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="2"> </font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span>Stiglitz also serves up mainland </span><span>China</span><span> as an example of a country that bucked the IMF and prospered. He writes that during the East Asian meltdown, as developing world countries with liberalized capital markets saw their incomes decline, </span><span>China</span><span>’s grew at a rate close to 8%. The country averted the crisis by taking “a course directly opposite that advocated by the IMF.”</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="2"> </font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span>But despite Stiglitz’s faith in capital controls, </span><span>China</span><span>’s economic ability to escape unscathed is only as believable as the financial numbers it issues. And articles in such publications as the <i>South China Morning Post </i>(“The Numbers Game,” May 31, 2002) and <i>Newsweek International</i> (“Why China Cooks the Books,” April 1, 2002) call the validity of those numbers into question, noting that numbers in China are often more of a political than a scientific tool. Stiglitz’s acceptance of </span><span>China</span><span>’s statistics without question may, however, lead some readers to question his objectivity.</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="2"> </font></span></p><p class="H3"><span>In his closing chapters, Stiglitz notes that globalization is here to stay, and says that if it is to work, there have to be global (as opposed to U.S.-dominated) public institutions that will help to set rules. One suggestion is to change the way that organizations like the IMF and World Bank are governed, primarily by revamping the system of voting rights that currently give the United States – as a primary contributor of funding – an effective veto.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="2"> </font></span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>While admitting that reform will be difficult, Stiglitz says that key changes should include recognition of the “dangers” of capital market liberalization; the replacement of IMF bailouts with nation-oriented bankruptcy and standstill provisions; improved safety nets, and disclosure of the expected poverty and unemployment impact of IMF programs. “If we are to address the legitimate concern of those who have expressed a discontent with globalization … then our voices must be raised,” concludes Stiglitz. “We cannot, we should not, stand idly by.” </span></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"></p><p class="DefinitionTerm"><span>Stiglitz has written a thought-provoking book, but in his quest to condemn the IMF’s <span> </span>approach, he appears to have chosen to ignore evidence that could undermine his position. For an economist, or any other scientist or academic, such a slip can only end up affecting the credibility of his views.</span></p><div></div>

But such income redistribution actually will end up hurting the middle and working classes, according to Edward Conard, visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and author of the book</em>, The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class.</p>
<p><em>“Growing income inequality is a real phenomenon, but a misdiagnosis of its causes and consequences leads to policies that slow growth and damage an already slow-growing economy,” Conard wrote. Instead, the path to robust economic growth — and higher wages for the working and middle classes — lies in encouraging businesses to take risks that lead to innovation, and having enough properly trained workers to hire in this knowledge-based economy. Conard recently talked about his book on the <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/category/business-radio/">Knowledge@Wharton Show on Sirius XM channel 111</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Tell us about this idea you had regarding the 1% and the 99% that was the basis for your book.</p>
<p><strong>Edward Conard</strong>: I provide explanations for why I think the 1% has been so successful, and also why the growth of the wages of the middle and working class has been slow, relative to GDP growth.</p>
<p>In the first case, we live in a knowledge-based economy. It’s not very capital intensive anymore. You see companies — the most obvious ones, such as Google, Facebook — can scale up to economy-wide success with very little need for capital, so the innovators who create those businesses can capture a larger share of the value that they create than the capital-intensive innovators in the past, who had to share the value more broadly with a lot more investors.</p>
<p>On the other side of the equation, I argue that because capital no longer constrains growth, that talent and risk-taking are now the constraints to growth, and that when you spread those constraints over more workers — low-skilled immigrants, for example — you see less supervision, lower productivity growth, and as a result, lower wage growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our workers at the high end of the wage scale are way more productive than the rest of the world’s workers.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Where have businesses failed in that process of trying to build up the workforce in general?</p>
<p><strong>Conard</strong>: When you think about talented workers, they can do three different tasks. One is they can create innovation — like an iPhone, for example, that grows the entire economy. They can become doctors and lawyers, who aren’t really producing innovation as much as they’re just keeping the gears moving. Or they can become supervisors of less-skilled labor, sometimes as entrepreneurs, although there’s a lot of high-tech entrepreneurialism on the innovation side where they try to organize hourly or less skillful workers, to make them more productive, more effective in serving the needs of customers, and that will also drive wages up.</p>
<p>If you look at the U.S. workforce, the statistics are actually quite shocking. About 25% of our workforce scores in the top third of academic tests, but 45% score in the bottom third, so we have about one high-skilled worker for every two lower-skilled workers. In Germany, it’s 1-to-1. In Scandinavia it’s 2-to-1. In Japan it’s 3-to-1. And so with fewer high-scoring workers relative to low-scoring workers, we’ve been able to produce faster growth, higher median wages, and much faster employment growth. U.S. employment grew twice as fast as Germany and France, three times faster than Japan.</p>
<p>So, our most talented workers in the United States are a very scarce resource, but because of our institutional capabilities like [those in] Silicon Valley, for example, our workers at the high end of the wage scale are way more productive than the rest of the world’s workers.</p>
<p>But what we see is this emerging opportunity on the innovation side. We see high wages on the doctor and lawyer side because of the shortage, and so what we see is a shortage of people who are really willing to roll up their sleeves and put lower-skilled workers to work. On top of that, is a huge influx of low-skilled workers. We have 40 million foreign-born adults, 20 million native-born adult children, 60 million adults, and 35 million of those are predominantly low-skilled Hispanic workers, and so what you see is we are spreading our skilled workforce over more unskilled workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: You talk about the fact that education in general in this country needs a little bit of a rethink to prepare kids for careers afterward. I think we don’t do that enough at times. But there are people who are working for companies right now, who may have been valuable resources for a company for 20 years, but the positions they have been in may be phased out. There needs to be more effort made to retrain them and bring them into another sector of the company.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>Conard</strong>: I’m a little bit skeptical about retraining. If you’ve spent your whole life in a job, and you’re 50 years old and you lose your job, it’s very difficult to get back to the same productivity level and find a similar job, to get retrained at 50, to enjoy five more years of high productivity. So I think we have to be very, very sensitive to those workers.</p>
<p>I do think in education, there’s an awful lot of emphasis on math and science, as if everybody at the top end of our test scores is going to go into science. Very few actually go into science. They largely go into business. We don’t really teach the business skills that are required to put your fellow man to work and to make him as productive as he can be and to serve customers as effectively as we can. I don’t think we necessarily have a shortage of talent. I believe that we have a shortage of properly trained talent.</p>
<p>I do make an argument that we should have a lower corporate tax rate — the lower the better because entrepreneurialism is one way to grow the economy. But it’s a very risky and tough row to hoe, because very few people end up being successful. You want to draw the world’s corporations [with lower tax rates, those that provide] the really high-quality, stable jobs — companies that have already been successful and have scaled [globally.] The more of those you can pull into the United States, the better. Then the last related recommendation I make is we should just go out and recruit the highest skilled workers.</p>
<p>We have a little more than 100 million full-time workers. The top 5% is 5 million. There are about 7 billion non-Americans in the world. The top 5% would be 350 million. [I estimate that the number of foreign high-quality workers who might move to the U.S. are] about 50 million. We issue a million green cards a year. So if we went out and issued, say, a half a million green cards to the top 5% of workers in that 50 million-person pool, we could radically shift the ratio of high-to-low skilled [worker] in this country. … We could potentially double the growth rate in the United States.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t think we necessarily have a shortage of talent. I believe that we have a shortage of properly trained talent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When the baby boomers retire, the Congressional Budget Office expects government spending as a percentage of GDP to grow by 9 percentage points. State, local and federal are already at 36% today. That would bring it to 45%. You’ve already got debt at 75% of GDP, so you need much faster growth than we can get organically. Then you have to worry, after you get done feeding all the baby boomers, that the Chinese are waiting to compete with you. You really need to conserve your resources for what could be an existential fight at the end of this road. I just think we have to find a way to engineer much higher growth than we can possibly achieve organically.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: What do you think is the best way to go about that? Obviously, the corporate tax issue is one that was a very important topic during the presidential race.</p>
<p><strong>Conard</strong>: The right target to try to hit is 15%. I think if you look at a lot of high-tech companies, they basically have a 15% tax rate. They’re doing that by paying the 15% to Ireland, instead of the United States.</p>
<p>We could bring [back] a lot of tax revenue that’s being paid offshore by companies [seeking] to lower their tax rate. … I argue that to offset that, we ought to raise the personal capital gains rate back to the ordinary income level, to try to neutralize as much of the lost revenue as we can. One of the reasons for having a low capital gains rate is because of the double taxation of profits — when they’re earned by companies, corporations pay taxes, and then when they’re distributed to shareholders, they do too.</p>
<p>If we could get the corporate tax down, there’s less reason for a lower capital gains rate. But it’s sort of like a consumption tax. If you pull the money out of the company and distribute it to the shareholders, you think of that income as consumption. If they really had investment opportunities, they would keep the money and reinvest it.</p>
<p>But if you do that, I think that probably gets pretty close to where we should optimally be on taxes. Otherwise, I think if you don’t cut spending, you can cut taxes and run up big deficits. It’s obvious to me that if I loan the government money or I pay them in taxes, then ultimately in the future, they’re going to come back and raise my taxes to pay off my loans, so I really paid those taxes today, not in the future. I think people are kidding themselves on that.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: You talked about risk a few minutes ago. What do you think are the main reasons why people and corporations don’t take more risk right now?</p>
<p><strong>Conard</strong>: I think there are a variety of reasons for that. One of them is we have become an innovation-driven economy, and innovation is riskier than traditional investment. It hasn’t really been funded by risk-averse savings debt, for example. We have no way to diversify all the risks and eliminate the undiversified risk — if you will, the investment-specific risks. What you see is a large portion of our workforce is actually exposed to investment-specific risk because they’re employees at companies.</p>
<p>I think part of it is they’re dialing back in other ways, to compensate for that increased risk. Part of it is, I think, that our financial system blew up. We recognize that banks are inherently unstable. We’ve made the Fed less effective than it was because of politics. I think people look at that and say, “I have to be a lot more cautious because of this risk I didn’t see in 2007.” And lastly, the trade deficit floods us with risk-averse savings. We buy a car from Germany. Germany doesn’t buy products from us that employ our workers. They loan us the money back. We have to take the risk to borrow and spend that money. We did that through subprime mortgages, basically subprime consumption. We’ve shut that down.</p>
<p>Companies are net-cash-flow positive, so on that, they’re contributing to risk-averse savings. They’re not really using them. Rich people never really borrowed against their wealth and took more risk. They don’t want to take more risk than just spending or investing all the money that they earned. So even when housing prices went up, they didn’t really borrow against the real estate, and spend more and invest more. So, you don’t really see other outlets.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have to find a way to engineer much higher growth than we can possibly achieve organically.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The other thing is the innovation economy. You see most of these companies with large cash piles because, in part, they’re worried that there’s going to be disruptive technology, and they want to swoop in and buy it so that it doesn’t disrupt their business. So you see a lot of these tech companies holding a tremendous amount of cash because they can’t risk putting all of their resources into internal development, and miss some innovation that disrupts their business.</p>
<p>If you look at Facebook, for example — Instagram would have had a major impact on Facebook, which is why Facebook bought it. Anybody who has kids knows this. And today, SnapChat’s going to have a major impact on Instagram. So if you are Facebook, you want the whole chain, from the picture you take and give to your friend, to the picture you put in your storyline, to the picture that you write a story about in your storyline. You want all three channels. They’re holding a lot of money to try to minimize the risk of disruption in this innovation age.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Where do you stand on the potential reduction of regulation?</p>
<p><strong>Conard</strong>: The first thing I’d say is that I think that if you look at a recent paper by [former Treasury Secretary] Larry Summers, it shows that we’ve put a lot of regulation on banking, and we haven’t really reduced the inherent instability of the banking system.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of risks in banking, by the way. One is, I make you a bad loan, and you can’t pay me back. We’ve got to make sure that the banks suffer 100% of the costs of making bad loans. Otherwise, they’ll make bad loans. We don’t want to bail them out for that. And it doesn’t look like we really did.</p>
<p>The second is inherent in this unstable equilibrium. If you leave the corn in the silo, instead of eating and planting it, it slows down growth, it slows down wages, it increases unemployment. You want to get the corn out of the silo and either invest it or consume it. That requires lending it, and somebody else borrowing it, and taking the risk of using it.</p>
<p>… You don’t want banks to go bankrupt in a bank run. … If you hold [banks] responsible for that, they have to hold a lot of corn in the silos to be able to pay out the depositors when they want withdrawals. Look at Goldman Sachs. It was shorting mortgages, and it still couldn’t pay withdrawals and basically would have gone bankrupt, had it not been for the Fed. And the Fed is actually a low-cost alternative for solving this problem. It can print money; let the depositors withdraw. When the panic subsides, the depositors put their money back in the banking system, they burn the money, and we get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: What is your the short term view on the U.S. economy going forward? President-elect Trump has said he believes he can find ways to see 4% GDP growth in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Conard</strong>: In order to grow faster, you have to reallocate your resources in a different way. And what is the most important resource? It’s properly trained talent. It’s the guys who go to Wharton who are the most valuable guys. … We have re-allocated them, say, from finance to technology — it’s probably a better use of our most important resource. [But then again] we might be over-allocated to technology. … You can end up with a lot of money if you win the tech lottery [by hitting it big in Silicon Valley], so we probably are over-allocating the talent there at the moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve issued a million green cards a year, largely to low-skilled workers. We have squandered the single best opportunity for growth.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the last eight years, we’ve issued a million green cards a year, largely to low-skilled workers. We have squandered the single best opportunity for growth, and that is to go out and get a million ultra-high-skilled workers every year, and bring in another 5 million and double the potential growth rate. I think it’s achievable that way.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s going to be achieved if we just cut taxes, but don’t change government spending. That’s going to have a small impact, not a large impact. If we change the investment incentives by changing the corporate tax rate and encouraging [higher-wage-paying global] companies to move here, those changes will have a gradual compounding effect, because workers work at companies that [are] like Google and Facebook. They have better on-the-job training. They coalesce into communities of experts, and those institutions make our workforce much more productive.</p>

						<p><em>Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, founder and executive chairman of think-tank Thailand Future Foundation, has worn many other hats. He started his career with McKinsey &amp; Company and put in a 10-year stint with the World Bank. He is managing partner of Advisor Co., a corporate advisory firm, and co-author of a recent report – “Thailand’s New Normal.” Suthiwart-Narueput argues that even if Thailand were to come out of the doldrums, it is unlikely to return to the growth rates of the previous decades. The recovery will be of a lower and slower trajectory — Thailand’s “new normal.” </em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Untitled1.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-97817 alignleft" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Untitled1.jpg" alt="Untitled1" width="182" height="176"></a>In the 1970s, when its neighbors — Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam — were mired in war, civil conflicts and Cold War intrigues, Thailand was plotting its economic future. From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, just before the Asian financial crisis, Thailand was known as a Teflon economy — one that </em><em>could continue to attract foreign tourists and money despite political turbulence. With</em><em> nearly two decades of double-digit growth, Thailand transformed itself from an agricultural economy to a modern industrial powerhouse. </em></p>
<p><em>Today, that dynamism has faded. A decade of political instability and sometimes violent protests since 2006, culminating in last year’s military coup, has finally taken its toll, with</em><em> Thailand’s economy seesawing between lackluster and negative growth. When former general Prayuth Chan-ocha</em><em> seized power on May 22, businesses thought it could see light at the end of the tunnel. But in the months after the coup, disappointing data showing weak exports, tepid public and private spending, falling prices in farm goods and falling domestic consumption have dashed these hopes. The general economic slowdown in Asia, radiating from China, does not help.</em></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><em>Thailand’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth last year, at 0.7%, was the lowest rate among ASEAN countries. The downtrend looks set to continue this year. Exports fell by 4.9% during the first half of the year and manufacturing fell 0.7% in the second quarter. Looking ahead, the picture is even gloomier. </em></p>
<p><em>As </em><em>Suthiwart-Narueput says in this interview with </em>Knowledge@Wharton<em>, the land</em><em> of the white elephant has clearly lost its mojo</em><em>. Suthiwart-Narueput also discusses structural headwinds — an aging population, declining labor force, low productivity and strong competition from other ASEAN countries. </em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Edited excerpts from the interview follow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In a background paper, “A Nation in Decline?,” published by your organization three years ago, the question was asked whether this would be Thailand’s “lost decade,” a decade of under-performance, just as the Philippines experienced in the last quarter of the 20th century. Three years on, does that question still apply?</p>
<blockquote><p>“One problem that has been a perennial issue in Thailand is our ability to execute.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> The short answer is yes. In terms of our long- term outlook the question remains valid. If we’re able to tackle the deeper, longer-term structural issues that we have left unaddressed, the outlook might be more positive. We’re likely to face what the Philippines did.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> The report “A Nation in Decline” argued that Thailand’s economic gains today are the result of efforts and policy decisions made in the 1980s. What’s currently in place to lay the groundwork for the next 10 years of growth and prosperity?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> It’s not clear whether we are making the kind of decisions that will secure our future like we did in the past. If you go back to the 1980s, there were three things that we did that were clever back then: the Eastern Seaboard, FDI (Foreign Direct Investment), and tourism in Phuket. The fact that we have a significant petrochemical factory is largely because of the investment on the Eastern Seaboard; petrochemicals are an important export for us. The FDI that we got helped us build our auto industry, which is one of our more competitive sectors. Tourism is obviously a great supporter of incomes in Thailand. A good chunk of the labor force is tied either directly or indirectly to tourism. So things that we have today are the result of those decisions taken in the past.</p>
<p>The question is: what decisions are we taking today? It’s not very clear. When you look at what we have done over, say, the past 10 years, regardless of which government was in power, most of the policies have been geared towards the demand side, stimulus measures, populist-type measures. Policies focused on the supply side — on enhancing our productivity, on longer-term issues of competitiveness, on developing new sectors along the lines that was done back in the 1980s — we haven’t seen those.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> One problem that has been a perennial issue in Thailand is our ability to execute. There have been talks for a very long time about these … large-scale infrastructure projects linking up with the region and our rail connections in the Mekong. The problem is getting these things done. Every government that comes along talks about big projects, mega projects. There’s a plan for everything here. The question is the ability to execute them.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What precisely is the problem with the execution? It’s not the lack of funding?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> Funding is not a huge issue. Public finances are reasonably strong. It’s got to do with a couple of things. One, the government is changing quite frequently …</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Political instability?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> But it’s not just political instability and change of government; it’s almost at a more micro level. The cabinet also changes a lot, even though you have the same government in place. So it’s political instability and administrative instability as well. I can’t remember any longer the number of education ministers we have had over the past years. The average tenure is less than a year.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Today, your competitors like Vietnam are far more competitive, and capable of taking business away from Thailand.</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> We’ve lost share, both on the trade front and on the FDI front. We’re not as attractive and competitive a place as before. A good chunk of that is caused by the fact that our wages have gone up a lot … and our productivity growth has not kept pace. So it has made our unit labor cost uncompetitive, particularly in sectors like electronics.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thailand’s economy is recovering, but … at a slower and lower growth trajectory…. It’s … like what happened after the Asian Crisis … the economy recovered but never recovered its mojo.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you look back 15 years, Vietnam was literally nowhere. They didn’t even export any electronics. But if you look recently, electronics exports from Vietnam are higher than those from Thailand. And we have seen examples of firms relocating away from Thailand. Samsung television, for example, they’re shutting down their production of TVs here and moving it to Vietnam. And the reason the Japanese are moving their factories to Vietnam is because they’re cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How do you think the slowdown in China is going to affect Thailand’s economy?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> A lot of analysts talk about how our export structure is fairly similar to that of China’s, so if China slows down or the renminbi depreciates, we would face increasing competition and pressure. But the channel that worries me the most in terms of China’s slowdown and the impact on Thailand is not so much on the export front but commodity prices. The reason is because 30%-plus of our labor force is still tied to agriculture, so when farm prices come down, it puts a lot of pressure on household incomes.</p>
<p>If you look at the main farm incomes, it’s from rice, rubber and sugarcane — all those three things are under pressure right now. Rice — we have these big overhangs in terms of stock from the government rice scheme. Rubber — when oil prices are low, rubber tends not to do so well, and oil prices are now quite low. Sugarcane prices are also under pressure because of Brazil. When the Brazilian real depreciates, it puts pressure on global sugar prices, because Brazil ends up exporting a lot more sugarcane instead of using it for ethanol. That’s happening already, so it’s whole complex of foreign prices.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> A perfect storm?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> In a sense. China has a big footprint in commodity prices, so when China slows down, we will get hit. The other channel that would have an effect on us but — touch wood, not so far — is tourism. A lot of our headline growth, almost all of it actually, in tourism in Thailand has come from China.</p>
<p>When you add up the sectors that are tied directly or indirectly to tourism — hotels, restaurants, retail, transport — about 20% of our labor force is either directly or indirectly affected by tourism. Thus far that’s held up quite well.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Let’s talk about the new normal, the title of your latest report on the Thai economy. What are the findings?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> Thailand’s economy is recovering, but we’re recovering at a slower and lower growth trajectory than before. It’s kind of like what happened after the Asian Crisis, where the economy recovered but it never recovered its mojo — the growth rate before the Asian Crisis. There are a bunch of reasons for that. Some of them are cyclical, but a lot of it is structural.</p>
<p>If you look at our growth rate in the previous decade, we were averaging about 5%. Our estimate for the long-term growth rate for the remaining decade is something close to 3%. Why? We start with the very basic. Our demographics are not good, to put it mildly. If you look at our previous decade, our labor force growth was clocking 1.2% per annum; this decade it’s down to 0.2%. So you have already lost 1%. On top of that, we have this slowdown in productivity growth of about another 60 basis points. So if you add those two numbers up, you shave about 1.6% off headline GDP growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thailand has not seen “policies focused on the supply side — on enhancing our productivity, on longer-term issues of competitiveness, on developing new sectors along the lines that was done back in the 1980s….”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are demand-side factors as well. I won’t go through all the gory details but will put my finger on one of the more important ones. As you mentioned, our exports have not been doing well, and if you look at the explanations offered by the ministry of commerce, they tend to say, oh yeah, the global economy has not recovered, the baht has been too strong, therefore exports haven’t done well. The danger with that assessment is it makes it sounds like temporary factors — that once the global economy recovers, once the baht weakens, we can go back to our glory export days. The short answer is we can’t, because they’re structural changes.</p>
<p>Some of the structural changes are changes that have to do with the world and are not specific to us. One thing that has affected not just Thailand but other countries in Southeast Asia, is that global trade isn’t growing as fast as it used to. Before the 2008 financial crisis, each percentage point of growth in global GDP translated roughly to 1.5% growth in global trade. That is now down to 0.3%.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> When did things go downhill for Thailand?</p>
<p><strong>Suthiwart-Narueput:</strong> 2011 was a critically bad year for us in Thailand. We had the floods and wages started rising very rapidly. So it was a double whammy. It’s hard to disentangle the data, to say which one was more significant.</p>
<p>One thing that hit investor confidence quite a bit was these big floods. It was an act of God. We can’t control that, but what we can control is our ability to respond to it. We said we would execute this flood management project but we haven’t delivered. So if you talk to people, you will hear what needs to be done. But, as I have said earlier, the problem is getting it done. We’re back to execution.</p>

						<p><em>Every city tells a story. More specifically, the geographical shape of an urban area is key to understanding its economic development. Is it compact and circular, making life more efficient for residents and businesses? Or is it marked by spatial sprawl, resulting in longer commutes? <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/harari/" target="_blank">Mariaflavia Harari</a>, Wharton professor of real estate, explores this notion in her forthcoming paper, “<a target="_blank" href="http://d1c25a6gwz7q5e.cloudfront.net/reports/2015-10-22-Harari_CityShape_11Jan2015.pdf">Cities in Bad Shape: Urban Geometry in India</a>.” Harari uses satellite images that show the shapes over time of 450 cities in India and compares that with economic indicators, such as housing rents and wages, to paint a revealing portrait about urban growth that has implications for policy makers as they plan for the future.</em></p>
<p><strong>Tweaking the Circle</strong></p>
<p>I work on urbanization and developing countries, and in my recent research I have looked at the spatial patterns of urbanization in India, trying to understand the economic implications of different city structures. If you look at urban areas from an airplane, for example, you can see that cities come in different shapes. Some have outlines that are roughly circular; others appear more fragmented, and yet others are constrained by their geographies. For instance, cities on islands or peninsulas end up having even more irregular shapes. My research question was what influence, if any, does a city’s shape have on the location choices of consumers and firms? Do consumers and firms benefit in terms of welfare or productivity from locating in cities with particular shapes?</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>Why would we expect city shape to matter at all from an economic standpoint? As urban planners have long recognized, city shape is one of the determinants of urban commuting efficiency, along with more widely studied factors, such as infrastructure or travel demand. More compact, more circular city geometries are conducive to shorter, within-city trips. To give you a sense of how this works, think of a circle. Now imagine that, holding the area constant, you start tweaking the circle, turning it into some irregular shape. As the shape of this polygon departs from that of a circle, becoming less and less compact, the average distance between points within this polygon will tend to increase. The same thing happens to cities as they expand in space.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As urban planners have long recognized, city shape is one of the determinants of urban commuting efficiency, along with more widely studied factors, such as infrastructure or travel demand.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A good, real-world example of these types of interactions is the comparison between Calcutta and Bangalore. Of the top cities in India, Calcutta is the least compact one. It kind of looks like an upside down giraffe head with a long, north-south tentacle. Bangalore, on the other hand, is more like a pentagon, and it’s the most compact one. I calculate that, all else being equal, if Calcutta had the same compact shape as Bangalore, the average within-city trip, proxied by the average distance between points within the city, would be shorter by 6.2 kilometers (3.8 miles). This is not trivial if you think that the average commuting speed in the top cities in India is around 15 kph.</p>

<p>If you look at a picture of the Earth at night taken from a satellite, urban areas are clearly visible as patches of light. I looked at the outlines of over 450 cities in India based on how they appear in nighttime satellite imagery. For each city, for each of these patches of light, I computed a number of indicators for geometric shape that are basically telling us the extent to which a city’s shape departs from that of a circle. I did this for multiple years to have a sense of the dynamic evolution of city shapes over time. And finally, I linked city shape to economic outcomes measured at the city level, such as population, average local wages and average housing rents. I found that households located in more compact cities are better off. First, more compact cities attract larger populations. Second, households that are located in more compact cities are implicitly paying a premium in terms of higher housing rents and net of local wages in order to live in cities with better geometries. This tells us that consumers are valuing city compactness as an urban amenity that they are willing to implicitly pay for. And this implied premium that they are paying is actually quite large. I estimate that households are trading off implicitly 5% of their income in order to live in cities that are more compact by one standard deviation. Now for the average city, a one standard deviation improvement in compactness implies that your average round-trip commute decreases by 720 meters. These are <em>potential</em> commute estimates based on the distribution of points within the city; these are not observed commutes that I can see in my data.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Consumers are valuing city compactness as an urban amenity that they are willing to implicitly pay for.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, firms are not affected in their productivity by city shape. Compact cities are just as productive, and compactness appears to be a pure consumption amenity. Now, you may worry that compact cities are systematically different from others in some dimension other than geometry. What if these more compact cities are also more successful, more developed cities that consumers like for reasons that are just correlated with geometry, but have nothing to do with it? To address the fact that these confounding factors might be biasing my results, I’m not simply making a crude comparison between compact and non-compact cities in my analysis. I look at what happens when a given city becomes less compact as a result of hitting some topographic obstacle, like a mountain or a lake, as it expands in space. What I find is that when a city ends up with a worse geometry because of hitting some geographic constraints, its population growth slows down, and housing rents and local wages tend to decrease.</p>
<p><strong>Growing up Versus Growing Out</strong></p>
<p>India is predicted to urbanize very rapidly in the next decades, and local policy makers need options to accommodate this urban growth. My findings suggest that accommodating this urban expansion in a more or less compact way can have potentially relevant implications for household welfare and urbanization patterns. Clearly, not all cities can be circular due to topography. In fact, at a descriptive level, one of the patterns that I find is that cities tend to become less and less compact over time as they expand. But there is room for land-use regulations to promote more or less compact development. As an example of this, in my work, I consider a regulatory tool that is quite controversial in India right now – vertical limits. These are restrictions on building heights that in India are considered very strict, relative to international standards. A lot of commentators and local policy makers are concerned that these stringent vertical limits are inducing sprawl and making cities spread out more. What I find is that cities that have more restrictive building height regulations end up having footprints that are not only larger but also less compact relative to what their topography and predicted growth would suggest. Relaxing these constraints would be a way at least to slow down the deterioration in city shape that city growth entails.</p>
<p>A second policy implication could be related to investments in urban infrastructure. One of my findings is that that negative consequences of bad city geometry are more pronounced in cities that have a poor road network. So, providing road infrastructure might be a way to compensate consumers for the poor shape of the city that they live in.</p>
<p><strong>Digging Deeper into the Data</strong></p>
<p>So far in my research, I have looked at city-level aggregate outcomes and compared the outlines of cities, looking at cross-city comparisons. What I’d like to do next is take this to a more disaggregated level and look at what happens within cities, look at the internal structure of cities. As a follow up to this project, it would be important to understand who bears the costs of longer commutes in cities that are not compact. What categories of consumers are affected the most? Perhaps it is low-income households that don’t have access to individual transportation. What consequences, if any, does city shape have on residential patterns, and in particular, residential segregation by socio-economic status? Are some kinds of city shapes more conducive to segregation and others more conductive to integration?</p>

They are the authors of </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cents-Sensibility-Economics-Learn-Humanities/dp/069117668X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510000712&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Cents+and+Sensibility%3A+What+Economics+Can+Learn+from+the+Humanities%2C">Cents and Sensibility: What Economics Can Learn from the Humanities</a><em>, Princeton University Press, 2017, from which this essay is based.

<p>Economics is a powerful discipline. Its analytical rigor, focus on tradeoffs and efficiency, and policies aimed at improving lives, make it an unusually important and influential field. And in a world where alternative facts increasingly masquerade as real ones and many deny the existence of “facts” at all, the statistical tools of economics serve as an antidote to sophism and political rhetoric.</p>
<p>But, boy, is economics full of itself.  A survey of American professors found that fewer than half of economists believed they had something to learn from other fields.  Seventy-nine per cent of psychology professors and 73% of sociologists thought that an interdisciplinary approach made sense; 42% of economists.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>That might surprise some.  Isn’t it the case that economists regularly look to other disciplines for their topics of study? Sure. But citation and similar data indicate that economists all too seldom engage with those disciplines in a serious way. Most economic models of human behavior disregard psychology, studies of the cycle of poverty ignore sociology and anthropology, and analyses of the past bypass historians.  It’s as if other fields have great questions, but economics has <em>all</em> the answers.</p>
<p>One might suppose that such arrogance is justified by a record of accurate predictions and effective policies.  If only. Quite the contrary, and yet failures seem to occasion no caution. After failing to anticipate the Great Recession, the long-term slowdown in labor productivity growth, the surprisingly sluggish nature of the last decade’s recovery, the surging U.S. stock market following the election of President Trump, and the increase in employment in the U.K. after the Brexit vote, one might suppose that economists have been chastened! Not that we can see. When you know some math and you have the ear of politicians and business leaders, it is hard to be humbled. Economists, no less than the rest of us, do what Jane Austen’s novels all warn us against:  they let their “pride and prejudice” block perception of contrary evidence and their own failures.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Novels … should be considered not just a literary form, but also a distinct way of understanding the social world.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Can we take the best of economics and make it less insular and more effective? We think so. And we don’t just mean incorporating the ideas of the qualitative social sciences, we mean reaching out to an area of study that seems especially distant – great literature.</p>
<p><strong>Culture, Narrative and Ethics</strong></p>
<p>Economic insights alone are insufficient when one considers how to foster economic growth in diverse cultures, the moral questions raised when universities pursue self-interest at the expense of their students, or deeply personal issues concerning health care, marriage, and families. In their passion for mathematically based explanations, economists struggle in at least three areas: accounting for culture, using narrative explanation and addressing ethical issues that cannot be reduced to economic categories.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>To understand people as cultural beings, one must tell stories about them. Human lives do not unfold in a predictable fashion the way Mars orbits the sun. Unlike algebra and Newtonian mechanics, life displays “narrativeness:” It requires explanation in terms of stories. And the best appreciation of narrative, and of how different eras shape people of various inclinations, can be found in novels, which should be considered not just a literary form, but also a distinct way of understanding the social world.  Although the events that novels describe are fictional, their shape, sequence, and ramifications often offer the most accurate account we have of <em>how</em> lives unfold. And what they teach about right and wrong is invaluable. There is no better source of ethical insight than the novels of Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, George Eliot, Jane Austen, Henry James, and the other great realists. Their stories distill the complexity of ethical questions that are too important to be entrusted to an overarching theory – questions that call for good judgment. By its very nature, judgment cannot be formalized. Moreover, reading literature and identifying with characters involves extensive practice in empathy, placing oneself in another’s shoes. If one has not identified with <em>Anna Karenina</em>, one has not really read <em>Anna Karenina</em>.</p>
<p>When you read a great novel and engage with its characters, you sense from within what it is like to be someone else. You see the world from the perspective of a different social class, gender, religion, culture, sexual orientation, moral understanding, or other features that define and differentiate human experience. By living a character’s life vicariously, you not only feel what she feels, but also reflect on those feelings, consider the nature of the actions to which they lead and, with practice, acquire the wisdom to appreciate actual people in all their complexity.</p>
<p>Understanding real people is at least as important in economics as in any discipline. If you don’t understand what motivates people, how can you possibly predict how they will act? Sure, you can simply assume that individuals act rationally and in their own self-interest. But even the founder of modern economics, Adam Smith, rejected that notion. To fully understand his seminal <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, one must also read his complementary volume, <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>, where Smith explicitly denied that human behavior could be adequately described in terms of people’s “rational choice” to maximize their individual utility. Not only do people often behave foolishly, their care for others is an “original passion” that is not reducible to selfish concerns. One needs a subtle appreciation for particulars, the sort of sensitivity that was dramatized a half-century after Smith’s moral treatise by Jane Austen and her successors.</p>
<p>But if literature is so valuable, why is its study and that of the humanities more broadly, in decline?  University enrollments and majors continue to plummet, and their professors feel under siege. Many fault the students – “all they care about is money,” “Twitter has reduced their attention span to that of a pithed frog.” Economists are understandably skeptical of explanations for declining markets that blame the consumers’ bad taste.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is no better source of ethical insight than the novels of Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, George Eliot, Jane Austen, Henry James, and the other great realists.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We tell a different story. For decades, many literature professors have argued that there is no such thing as “great literature,” but only things called great literature, because hegemonic forces of oppression have mystified us into believing in objective greatness. But if Shakespeare, Milton and Tolstoy are no more important than any other writing, why invest the considerable effort to read them? <em>Paradise Lost</em> is difficult; <em>War and Peace</em> is long. Many students leave secondary schools without having any grasp of what reading great works entails. Their exams test knowledge of facts about literature, not actually understanding it. They are taught to hunt for symbols, to judge writers according to current values, or to treat masterpieces as mere documents of their times. And that approach is commonly repeated at the college level.</p>
<p><strong>Too Simplistic</strong></p>
<p>A clear sign that something has gone astray is that a story is reduced to a simple message. Only mediocre literature can be read that way. Otherwise, why not just memorize messages? Love your neighbor (<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>); help the unfortunate (<em>Les Mis</em><em>érables</em>); child abuse is wrong (<em>Jane Eyre</em> and <em>David Copperfield</em>); Do not kill old ladies, even really mean ones (<em>Crime and Punishment</em>); first impressions can be misleading (<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>); don’t give in to jealousy (<em>Othello</em>); obsessions can be dangerous (<em>Moby Dick</em>); stop moping and do something! (<em>Hamlet</em>); there’s no fool like an old fool (<em>King Lear</em>).</p>
<p>If you can’t provide a compelling reason why brief summaries will not do, and why it is important to read it attentively, then you have not really taught, or learned, literature. When we argue that economics can learn from novels, we approach great literature as a source of wisdom and insight that cannot be obtained, or obtained so well, elsewhere.</p>
<p>Examples abound.</p>
<p>In 2014 when the U.S. placed sanctions on Russia after Russian troops seized Crimea from the Ukraine, how did President Putin respond? By imposing self-sanctions, banning imports of many agricultural products from the U.S. and Europe. Economists might be baffled by such an “irrational” act. But read the classics of Russian literature and you are not surprised. Westerners typically assume the state exists to serve individuals, Russians, often enough, the reverse. People come and go, but Russia remains. Far from unwelcome, sacrifice and suffering for the nation can justify lives and be deliberately embraced.</p>
<p>What about the shock of the Brexit vote or the election of President Trump? Weren’t many of those voters actually voting against their own economic self-interest? That is heresy for economists! Maybe some of these voters were, as Dostoevsky wrote so brilliantly in <em>Notes from Underground</em>, deliberately acting against their self-interest precisely to show that they can be unpredictable. The choice being made is to exercise the right to act <em>against</em> our interests since that action “preserves for us what is most precious and most important – that is, our personality, our individuality.” Perhaps pundits and professors should get out more – meet those who are angry about feeling disenfranchised, listen to what they actually say, and read their stories as they, not their cultural betters, would tell them. In retrospect, the clues were there.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Before you dictate policy, gain an appreciation of a nation’s attitudes, politics, religion and history – all that a nation’s literature is best able to provide.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And of all the areas of economic policy that have disappointed, it is probably the limited impact of well-meaning investments in the developing world that has been most painful. “Getting the prices right” by reducing government subsidies for key consumer items might make sense in the classroom, but the real world demands nuance and cultural understanding. Can you reasonably expect that what works on one continent or in one country can simply be transferred to another? Before you dictate policy, gain an appreciation of a nation’s attitudes, politics, religion and history – all that a nation’s literature is best able to provide.</p>
<p>A final example where literature might improve policy: Enrolling more low-income students in elite colleges and universities. Despite various outreach efforts and substantial reductions in price, “undermatching” persists, where talented students from limited means attend open enrollment or modestly selective schools rather than the prestigious institutions eager to enroll them. But put yourself in the place of those students, worried that they have the wrong accent, beliefs and manners to thrive at an Ivy League school or at Oxbridge. And one way to do exactly that is to read any number of great novels where young men and women from the provinces try to succeed in the big city. From Balzac to Dickens to Chekhov, the reader inhabits the space of someone struggling to fit within “proper” society.  As literature makes clear, matchmaking, whether by friends, grandparents, or college admissions officers, is not easy, as Jane Austen’s Emma Woodhouse repeatedly discover. Class differences run deep, and matchmakers are apt to assume their own preferences in trying to ensure a happy pairing. Once they appreciate that, schools might develop more programs that allow students from disadvantaged backgrounds to feel that an elite school doesn’t just want them there for its own sake, but is willing to make them feel at home. Providing need-based financial aid helps, but there is much more to belonging than affordability.</p>
<p>Will taking literature seriously transform the field of economics? Of course not. But we believe that learning from literature, philosophy and the other humanities, along with history, sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science, religion and the like, may lead economists to develop more realistic models of human behavior, increase the accuracy of their predictions, and come up with policies that are more effective and more just. After all, what do we have to lose?</p>
<p>As Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, put it recently when considering the failure of the Treasury, the IMF, and the OECD to anticipate employment and investment growth after the Brexit vote as opposed to their forecast of a recession, “Out of this crisis, there could be a rebirth of economics…” Perhaps that rebirth can begin in the library.</p>

<p><span>An edited transcript of the conversation follows:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>What are the biggest challenges facing the global economy today as you observe the current landscape?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn Kydland:</span></strong> <span>I think the biggest challenge is the lack of predictability of government policies. It has different facets. The theory with which I’m associated with is called the inconsistency of optimal government policy, or the time inconsistency, I should say. So what it says is even in the case of a benign government who’s trying to maximize welfare, the present value of its citizens’ welfare — imagine we can measure that — the resulting optimal plan is time-inconsistent, in the sense that there will always be this</span> <span>temptation to change </span><span>in the absence of a commitment mechanism to make sure that it’s carried through over time. There will always be a temptation to change that plan, and if they continue to do so, theory suggests that that could be quite harmful to society.</span> <span>I never tried to push that as particularly relevant to the world until the last four or five years. And now it seems extremely relevant.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>What was it that struck you as relevant, that clicked together the theory and reality?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>Well, it kind of has this loose prediction that especially in the case of where the government can argue there’s an emergency, they will focus more on short-term issues rather than the long-run, even though most economists will agree that the long-run is much more important than the short-run. And I think one could associate much of what the U.S. government and European governments have done in the past few years, loosely with this theory. It’s not that surprising an outcome, and if it becomes obvious that the governments are not behaving very consistently over time, then it becomes harder to predict what they’re going to do, say one or two, or five years into the future. Many of the important decisions that drive private decisions that drive long-run growth, investment in new productive capacity, innovative activity — not just in better way of producing things but in production processes, new products and so on — entrepreneurial activity, they’re very forward-looking decisions, where if you become uncertain about the future or you worry that say the taxes on the returns from your activity will go up in the future, that could just mean that you’ve become much more reluctant to undertake such activity, or you postpone it until you gain greater confidence. And I think governments recently have lost some confidence among investors, and that could be harmful… It’s a challenge facing these forward-looking decision-makers to decide what can I expect from government in the next few years. It’s also a challenge for governments themselves to rebuild this credibility that would be beneficial for the longer-run.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>From your vantage as an informed observer, when you look at what the U.S. and Europe are doing in terms of their governmental policies, what’s your assessment, and are you concerned?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>I’m mainly concerned about fiscal policy. Monetary policy I think has been carried out, I really can’t complain about it and it’s not that important for the long-run anyway, at least under normal circumstances. I think it’s fiscal policy, tax policy, government spending and so on that are the key aspects of government policy that can play a role for real activity. And the buildup of government debts in many countries I think is a great concern, but because presumably at some point someone will have to pay for it, and the question is who? Will it be me, as an investor in future productive activities or an investor in entrepreneurial activity and so on? And if you think that there’s a chance, a good chance, that say the income on those returns, say capital income taxes will go up-just to pull numbers out of a hat-from 40 to 50 percent, that will make many projects that are otherwise would have been profitable will make them unprofitable. And so it would hamper investment activity, and that seems to be what has happened, in the United States at least. I have not looked at the data for Europe.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the things I do in my public lectures is I show a picture of real GDP per capita since 1947, which is pretty much when good data begin. If you take a constant growth rate trend through the data from ’47 through 2007-a constant growth rate trend works pretty well-I mean the picture looks at their ups and downs corresponding to the business cycles, but by and large…the data correspond well to a constant growth rate trend. And then after 2008, 2009, boom, you drop 10 or 12 percent below trend and that’s in large part because of investment activity has dropped. And I’ve done some model experiments myself with a coauthor from the Dallas Fed and this notion that suddenly, or around that time people were getting more concerned about the government debt and worried about possibly taxes going up in the future, if such an expectation became prevalent it would be consistent with the drop that we have seen and it’s also consistent with their recovery being very slow. So that would be a source concern.</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><span>Now it’s true that Bush introduced this temporary reduction in taxes that was due to expire January 1st 2011, this year, as it turns out it was postponed. At the last minute, they postponed the increase by two years, until January 1st, 2013, but two years…doesn’t make much of a difference for investment behavior, so the prediction would stand whether they expected it in 2011 or 2013, it still remains to be seen whether what’s going to happen by then. It’s something for investors to worry about. It’s a prediction of this time-inconsistency literature that that’s where they’re likely to look for sources of revenue and it’s also empirically what happened the last time the government debt showed such a buildup during World War II. After World War II, the debt was reduced dramatically starting in the 50s primarily by an increase in taxes on capital, physical human capital.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Given where we are right now, do entrepreneurs still have a place at the table?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>They’re crucial. In any vibrant economy the entrepreneurs are, based on what I know, they are the key driving force for long-run growth. It’s true that large companies also experience some growth. But I believe studies show that the key to long-run growth are the smaller companies, the startups, the entrepreneurs- who are maybe struggling, may need financial support, ways of financing their activities-so they rely on a well-functioning financial system. If they become more reluctant, let’s say, to engage in that sort of activity that’s not good for the long run of the economy.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Do you think that the problems or forces that created the recession, the global economic woes have been remedied?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>No, I don’t think so. And it goes back to what I said about the uncertainty about future government policy. There’s no more certainty now than there was two years ago, I don’t think, and until there becomes more certainty or more transparency in what they’re going to do for more than the next few months then I’m not very optimistic. I don’t think we have solved very much. And some time has elapsed since the big decline and so far the economy has been growing but at slow rates.</span></p>
<p><span>I should say by the way there is another reason that one could have become worried about the debt around 2008, 2009-and that is even before the decline, even before 2008, it’s not as if the government budget situation was rosy. I had a PhD student in the late ’90s whose thesis was motivated by dire predictions, by so-called intergenerational accounting specialists who claim that because of the projected retirement of baby boomers starting in before now in fact, once that started happening the government budget constraint was in such a bad shape taxes had to rise. This was before all the bad stuff happened, now they’ve engaged in the stimulus packages and the temporary tax reductions, they’re not huge amounts in the big picture, but they certainly don’t help the budget situation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Has the so-called ‘double-dip’ recession occurred or is there potential for it to occur?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>According to the data, it hasn’t happened in the sense that real GDP hasn’t started falling. But in a sense, I like to look at it relative to trend. And we’ve been moving further away from this trend. We already dropped by 10 or 12 percent in 2008-2009, and growth rates of around 1 percent or whatever they have been, that’s not enough to start moving back towards trend. So even without an actual dip, that’s still pretty bad.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s dismal enough, because you would like some kind of a springing back from that bottom. Normally, that would reasonable to expect and so I think policy-makers have to be really inept to essentially prevent that from happening.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Turning to this region, with the onset of the Arab Spring, there are some countries completely reinventing themselves. We wondered if you had any insight on these emerging economies and how they might develop and what role they might have on the global stage?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>I don’t have any data on which to base any assessment. One thing I know is if you sum up economic activity in all the Arab countries, if you see them as one bloc of nations, that’s pretty sizeable in terms of total population, potential for economic activity and so on. And it’s certainly something that I think the Untied States and Europe should pay attention to, not just India and China, but the combination of Arab countries. I know in the United States it may not be very popular among the public in general, I think that sort of a sentiment is very irrational; and probably in Europe they’re more amenable to interaction with Arab nations. And I think they should. I think it’s in everyone’s interest that these nations, now that they’ve acquired more freedom, that one trades with them and I think it’s in everyone’s interest that they develop at reasonable speeds and grow reasonably fast.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>What do you think of the development model of the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries? Do you think it’s viable?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>I admit that I don’t know enough. One thing I would like to know more about is does this region grow because of competitive activity, entrepreneurial activity among its citizens or is it the government deciding where to develop? I admit that I’m somewhat suspicious about governments being the ones thinking they know where to go, because there’s lots of experience about bad incentives being in action when that happens, unlike economic activity that developed naturally through well-functioning banking system, entrepreneurs either having their own funds but also to some extent getting funding for profitable projects. They tend, by and large, I think they see more clearly where the profitable opportunities are than the government. But at the same time, it does seem that the UAE, for example, they are trying to put an environment in place with good infrastructure and so on where such private activity is permitted to flourish and it makes it easier and so on. In absent (of) any hard and fast evidence, I suppose that’s the potential rosy picture I can paint and maybe that’s realistic.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>When it comes to other emerging economies, what comes to mind when you observe India and China? What could their impact be on the global economic order?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>First of all, I think India and China, for example, you mentioned them, they deserve to grow. If you look at income per capita in both nations it’s not very high. I mean China I believe it’s still under US$10,000 a person, and in the United States and in more well-to-do European nations it’s four times that. The recommendation that I would make about India, to ensure that they do well in the longer run, would be to remove much of the bureaucracy. …There’s a ranking put out every year about how many days or how much resources is needed to set up a new company in various countries and India ranks pretty low. So they can do pretty well for a while but in the long run that’s an issue they probably need to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>In China also, I think the greatest problem is that too much is state-run. The banks are state-owned, there are virtually no private banks; there are state-owned companies, they have easy access to loans from the state-run banks. And meanwhile, as we talked about earlier, the key to long-run growth is usually entrepreneurial activity. And in China, I learned from a paper by a former student of mine, his name is (Kjetil) Storesletten, he published a paper in the American Economic Review, one of the top three journals in economics last year, "Growing Like China" was the title. So I learnt a lot from that article, and what I learnt there was that it seems that entrepreneurs, in order to engage in their activity, they need to save up first. In other words, it’s difficult for them to get loans for their activity and also because of that they’re pushed into or they’re biased towards more labor-intensive activities. And if that continues, it’s not good for the long-run of the nation. Meantime, the large companies, because of the easy access to loans, because of the easy access to cheap labor they can show sizeable profits even if what they do is not necessarily that productive. But that sort of thing cannot continue forever, I don’t think. And so I think for China to do really well in the long-run, they would have to open up for more competition in the banking sector. That’s sort of a conclusion I drew from reading that article by Storesletten.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Do you find any holes or gaps in the way institutions are training or educating students within the field of economics? Is there anything that needs to be recalibrated at the graduate level?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>I’m quite optimistic. It used to be that the United States really had a dominance in training potential professors for the doctoral thesis or their research training. I’m encouraged by the trend in Europe to improve the research training in most countries. Many European nations have this arcane form of a doctoral degree, where you basically sat on your own without any courses or anything and tried to come up with a dissertation, or very few courses. So I think many European countries have moved more in the direction of adapting a similar system as the one in the United States that has been shown to function well. Of course, there are ways of improving any such way of training.</span></p>
<p><span>Where I used to be at Carnegie Mellon (University), they had a very unique form of doctoral training, where they relied less on courses and more on learning by doing, early on in their studies. So students are required to write their potentially publishable research paper in the first summer and another one in the second summer, and many of these get published. But it helps that their doctoral program is small. So when I’ve suggested it for some of the bigger places they say there’s too much variability in the research potential of their students and just so many of them run into the fact that it would be difficult to do. But I know it’s also been done at the business school in Stanford and so on. So those are minor things that if they could be adopted by other places would make the research training even more efficient. But I think by and large, it’s greater this improvement in the quality in Europe, especially this recent phenomenon, and a good phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Is there any room for improvement with how general economics is taught at the introductory stages, say at the undergraduate level or in businesses schools?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kydland:</span></strong> <span>I don’t think there are any complaints about microeconomics. But macroeconomics, I always tell the students from the beginning, all the interesting phenomena in macroeconomics are dynamic, they’re forward-looking. That might be a slight overstatement, but by and large that’s true. Dynamic macroeconomics is difficult to do on paper, and for that reason, many undergraduate textbooks I think are lacking in the training they give the students in that sense along that dimension. And I’ve thought a bit about what could be done about it: if it’s hard to do on paper, then what you do?</span></p>
<p><span>One thing I’ve taken the initiative, with the help of information system experts, is to take the web or computer into use or let the computer help you help the students see the dynamics of what happens, if response to shocks to the economy let’s say, look at the propagation of these shocks in a form of impulse responses as we call them and so on. I’ve used that approach myself with some luck. Certainly the top half of the class tends to be enthusiastic about that, it tends to be a little difficult for some students. There’s always a tradeoff. But I think it’s important to give the students the sense of the forward-lookingness or the potential importance of the expectation by future government policy, for example.</span></p>

						<p>The year 2016 started with a bang in China, but unfortunately, not with traditional firecrackers. Instead, economic data showing the 10th-straight month of slowing domestic manufacturing sent China’s stock markets into a downward spiral, triggering the market’s newly instituted circuit breakers and shutting down trading on January 4 and again on January 7. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 6.9% on January 4, triggering a worldwide selloff and a dour start to the year in global equity markets. On January 7, stocks dropped by more than 7% after just 29 minutes of trading.</p>
<p>In addition to jitters about the domestic economy, says Marshall Meyer, an emeritus professor of management at Wharton, the “perpetual low level conflict in the Mideast” is rattling China. “Disruption of energy resources in China poses real difficulties for them and tells you where their real Achilles heel lies.”</p>
<p>With that stunning debut, in many ways China’s economic outlook in 2016 might not be so difficult to predict. The forecast calls for continuing slowdown — with the Chinese central government likely to declare an official GDP target of around 6.5% for the New Year, down from around 7.5% for 2015. The government is likely to announce actual GDP growth for the old year at 6.8%, according to experts, while the International Monetary Fund anticipates 6.3% for 2016.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>But despite the overall trajectory, in many other respects, China’s 2016 economic outlook is entirely unpredictable — perhaps more so than at any other time in recent memory, say Wharton and other experts. “<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.wharton.upenn.edu%2Farticle%2Fthe-great-economic-recasting-can-china-pull-it-off%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknlg.net%2F1RliEiO&amp;source=tweetbutton&amp;text=Uncertainty%20is%20the%20watchword%20for%20investors%2C%20developers%20or%20anyone%20doing%20business%20in%20China%20in%202016" class="fyc_printfriendly tweetthislink" target="_blank">Uncertainty is the watchword for investors, developers or anyone doing business in China in 2016 <i class="ss-icon ss-social" style="font-size:10pt">Twitter</i> </a>,” says Minyuan Zhao, a management professor at Wharton. “Of course, slowdown is the biggest theme. But after 30 years of fast growth, no one should be surprised by that, especially with China’s demographic change [to an aging population] and over-investment since the 2008 financial crisis.”</p>
<p><strong>The X Factor</strong></p>
<p>Instead, the X factor is the outlook for government policy, Zhao adds: “We’d like to see with more clarity where policy is going and how the general business environment will shake out. Difficult reforms, which investors have been waiting on for a long time, have not really materialized. They include whether state-owned enterprise (SOE) and financial market reforms will happen and if yes, in which direction. The market has had no consensus yet where the economy is going in 2016 … in terms of policies, or basically, the future business landscape for managers or investors.”</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, Chinese officials “are walking a fine line and doing well, but the risks are on the downside if the slowdown in industry gets worse and spills out to other sectors.” <span class="attribution">–David Dollar</span></p></blockquote>
<p>As China shifts from three decades of speedy growth built upon manufacturing, investment and export prowess to an era of slower growth based upon domestic consumption, private-sector entrepreneurship, innovation and services, clarity about the new rules of the road can help with a smoother transition, say experts. “From a managers’ perspective, top questions involve industrial policies — what is allowed and what is not, who can join and who cannot,” explains Zhao. “For most managers, it’s better to see a clear line. For example, in the financial world, initial public offerings have been put off, put on and then off again. It’s helpful to have some clarity, so you can look three to five years in the future to know what you’re working towards. Clarity and certainty allow managers and investors to make long-term plans.”</p>
<p>But it is unclear to what extent and at what pace the government will adopt reforms officials have promised to help the economy evolve from a state-directed system into a more market-driven one. Too fast a transition risks the shuttering of unprofitable state-backed and other enterprises in bloated sectors, chancing widespread unemployment and social unrest.</p>
<p>A disorderly and precipitous economic slowdown in China could also plunge other economies around the world into a downward spin. “Even more important than a structural shift from manufacturing to services, you need a certain amount of growth to sustain reasonable tightness of the labor market,” says Pieter Bottelier, an adjunct professor of China studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>According to David Dollar, a senior fellow at the foreign policy and global economy and development programs at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., so far, Chinese officials “are walking a fine line and doing well, but the risks are on the downside if the slowdown in industry gets worse and spills out to other sectors. What global markets are worried about is a more serious slowdown that’s bad for China and bad for the world economy.”</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Adds <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/zjzhang/" target="_blank">Z. John Zhang</a>, Wharton marketing professor and director of the <a target="_blank" href="http://pwcc.upenn.edu/zh/">Penn Wharton China Center</a>, “In the end, it’s hard to tell how China’s economic challenges and the government’s determination to meet those challenges will play out.”</p>
<p><strong>Glimpse of the Market at Play</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, allowing market forces greater sway means China’s economic managers may lose some control over the largely orderly soft landing they’ve been able to engineer so far. The summer of 2015 provides a glimpse: Starting in late 2014, the government began opening up major Chinese stock markets to foreign investors and encouraging domestic investors to enter the markets. Chinese stock exchanges peaked on June 12, 2015, more than doubling over the previous 12 months. But then the Shanghai composite index <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/chinese-stocks-whats-behind-the-great-market-tumble/">fell 28% between June 12 and July 2</a>, while the Shenzhen Composite Index lost a third of its value.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Credit rollovers are bad and are creating a new supply of non-performing loans that have to be dealt with eventually, but they’re not as bad as closing enterprises and layoffs.” <span class="attribution">–Pieter Bottelier</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Though the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) then cut interest rates, and the government undertook numerous other market-propping steps, including suspending IPOs, requesting brokerage firms and insurance companies <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/whats-behind-chinas-stock-market-gamble/">to put more money into the markets</a>, and launching investigations of market manipulation by securities regulators and others, market volatility continued. On August 24, the Shanghai Composite Index suffered its biggest one-day drop in almost a decade, losing about 40% in value from its mid-June peak.</p>
<p>Exacerbating this scenario was a <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/will-the-yuans-fall-force-china-to-re-energize-reforms/">devaluation of the yuan</a> on August 11 that took global markets by surprise. On that day, the PBOC cut the yuan’s daily reference rate by 1.9%, prompting the currency’s biggest one-day drop since 1994. The devaluation sent global stock markets tumbling, as investors interpreted the move as a salvo in a new round of global currency wars. On January 7, the PBOC shook the markets by setting the official midpoint rate on the yuan to 0.5% weaker, at 6.5646 per dollar — its lowest since March 2011, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-yuan-midpoint-idUSKBN0UL07Z20160107">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>Closer to reality, the devaluation was an effort to allow the market greater say in setting exchange rates to position the yuan for acceptance by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) into the basket of currencies that compose the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR’s) reserve currency. Indeed, the IMF <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/what-the-imfs-yuan-decision-will-mean-for-china-and-global-markets/">did go on to accept</a> the yuan as part of the SDR basket in December, a goal long pursued by China. The PBOC also since moved to a new system for setting the yuan’s exchange rate versus a basket of currencies, not just the dollar.</p>
<p>China’s foray into financial liberalization provides a reminder that government managers can no longer expect to contain market reactions. “That exchange rate decision [of August 11] compounded market nervousness about the Party’s ability to manage the economy, because it screwed up badly on the exchange markets in June and July,” says Bottelier. Says William Adams, vice president and international economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh: “As China takes dramatic steps to liberalize its financial system and open borders to international flows of capital, those moves potentially introduce new sources of volatility and uncertainty to the Chinese economy. Alternatively, the free flow of capital means that Chinese financial volatility could potentially trigger episodes of global financial volatility, too.”</p>
<p>Adams expects further depreciation of the yuan in 2016. Most currencies have depreciated more than 20% against the dollar since mid-2014, while the yuan has depreciated a little less than 5%, he notes. “Market forces are arguing for a weaker yuan,” especially when the Chinese economy is slowing and the yuan is still relatively strong to the yen, euro and other non-dollar currencies, he says. In turn, a weaker yuan would help Chinese exports and stem a long-running slide in producer prices, he adds.</p>
<p><strong>Crisis Ahead in 2016?</strong></p>
<p>Even with so many stresses in the transitioning Chinese economy, many experts say the potential for a crisis in either the financial markets or in the real economy in 2016 seem minimal. “So many potential crises are things we’ve been talking about for years,” says Adams. “But the crises haven’t happened yet, including risks from a property market collapse, overcapacity in industry, and corporate and local government debt overhang. It’s hard to say why 2016 would be different from 2015, though the prospect can’t be entirely discounted.”</p>
<p>One important sector to watch is real estate, a key question governing how far GDP will fall, says Bottelier: “There’s a tremendous supply overhang in many cities, dating back to the 2008-2010 stimulus program, which vastly over-expanded credit for real estate development. Many thousands of developers have since scaled back significantly on investment in new floor space, which has a depressing effect on raw materials, factories that make doors and windows, furniture for new apartments and the like. But normalization between supply and demand in the property sector should come in the next 12 to 18 months.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Though some industries suffer from overcapacity, there’s still a significant shortage in health care and education…. The moment you show the direction, a lot of resources and energy in the country will come forward.” <span class="attribution">–Minyuan Zhao</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, the unwinding of industrial overcapacity in the manufacturing sectors continues to loom. Yet, says Bottelier: “We haven’t seen the level of bankruptcy that you’d expect in a normal market. Bankruptcies, especially at the local level, have largely been avoided because of loan rollovers. Credit rollovers are bad and are creating a new supply of non-performing loans that have to be dealt with eventually, but they’re not as bad as closing enterprises and layoffs.” Wharton’s Zhao agrees, noting that “it’s a ticking time bomb, but does anyone want to bear the consequence of street protests? This is no different from the U.S. when policy makers kick the can down the road time and again.”</p>
<p><strong>The Good News</strong></p>
<p>While China’s manufacturing and real estate sectors undergo a painful restructuring, “the good news is that services and consumption are growing well, the labor market is fairly tight, and wages and household incomes are going up,” says Brookings’ Dollar. “The duality where income and consumption are growing well, while industry is in trouble, is a little surprising. One risk in 2016 is those problems in industry get worse, causing firms to close, putting workers out of work and adversely affecting wages and consumption growth. But if they can maintain this situation of healthy growth in consumption and services, that’s a good growth path in China.”</p>
<p>Wharton’s Zhao agrees: “There’s still a lot of pent-up energy in China. The consumer market and services industry are going strong, and there’s a lot of discussion on the transition from ‘Made in China’ to ‘Made for China’ to take advantage of the large market. Though some industries suffer from overcapacity, there’s still a significant shortage in health care, education and all that. The moment you show the direction, a lot of resources and energy in the country will come forward.”</p>
<p>PNC’s Adams points out that China experienced the fastest monthly retail sales growth in November for the year. Online retail giant Alibaba reported 60% year-over-year sales growth on November 11, Singles Day, <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/what-u-s-retailers-can-learn-from-alibabas-singles-day-success/">a big retail event in China</a>. “Discretionary spending in the consumer sector can’t be in that much trouble,” he says. “There are signs of a shift to a more consumer-driven economy, which sooner or later, will affect income growth.” Indeed, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, national per capita disposable income, adjusted for inflation, rose 7.7% year-over-year in the first three quarters of 2015.</p>
<p>SAIS’s Bottelier agrees: “In spite of a serious economic slowdown, wages in most of the labor market, from unskilled to semi-skilled, continue to rise,” supporting consumer spending and the rise of a middle class. The shift from manufacturing to services, which supports greater employment, and the slowing supply of migrant labor in relation to continued demand help explain the phenomenon, he says. In addition, a boom in domestic value-added, high-end manufacturing is supporting higher paychecks, he adds.</p>
<p>With the Chinese economic outlook still uncertain and a rising interest rate environment in the U.S., many wealthy Chinese are sending their money — and their children — abroad. Says Wharton’s Zhao: “At this point, uncertainty is driving both talent and money to safe havens.” But, she adds: “It’s not necessarily a trend going forward if China can implement clear policies on investment and reform. I know many people put their money overseas to buy real estate in New York and California, and send their kids to college in the U.S. They don’t see these as the best investments, because they know better how to invest in China.”</p>
<p>Indeed, says Bottelier: “Economic rebalancing is major theme that will take many years to begin to work. It’s a very difficult long-term process that’s bound to be misunderstood and misinterpreted by many with a shorter-term horizon. If they can get through the next 12 to 18 months without major problems in the labor or property markets, the benefits of rebalancing will begin to be more visible.”</p>
<p>In the end, says Wharton’s Zhang, “You cannot just look at GDP. It means something but not everything. You can have bad, non-performing GDP, or you can have good GDP.” Presumably, good GDP lies ahead if both Chinese policy makers and citizens can make build the foundations of more consumer-led growth.</p>

						<p><em>Social and economic activist Wendy Luhabe passionately believes in empowering women, especially when it comes to realizing their potential in contributing to the economy. </em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You describe yourself as an economic activist. You’re based in South Africa. What is an economic activist?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Luhabe:</strong> In my case, it’s focusing on the participation of women in the economy. When I thought about what we’ve been doing, I realized that you hear of social activists or political activists, but you don’t hear of economic activists. The work we’ve done deserves the description. We pioneered two ventures: the first one was an investment company we started 20 years ago. It mobilized 18,000 women to become investors for the first time through a platform called Women Investment Portfolio Holdings. The company is still in existence. It has a value of about $200 million.</p>
<p>After that, about 10 years later, we started a private equity fund for women, which was also an unheard of concept in the world. There are less than 10 funds that are focusing on women-owned enterprises. This was definitely the first and probably still the only one in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> That company still exists as well?</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

	</div>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> The fund has closed but several of the investments are still in existence.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In the private equity company, were you solely focused on investing in women-owned businesses?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In the first case, it was women investors?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> Yes. In the second case, it was investing in companies owned by women. My view is that if we grow the number of women entrepreneurs and give them access to capital and the business expertise to enlarge their businesses, they will contribute towards creating jobs, which is a major challenge in South Africa.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We wanted to take women beyond that to say, you can provide labor and you can consume, but you can also be an investor responsible for your own financial independence.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How did you come to this? What was your pathway that led to these very bold and entrepreneurial moves?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> It was a combination of things. South Africa was becoming a democracy and we had politicians who were committed to gender empowerment and passed legislation that made it possible. So it was largely the environment. Observing that as the political landscape was being rearranged and women were being left out, we decided that we would create our own opportunities rather than wait to be invited. That’s how it happened.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You had a background in finance?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> I studied commerce. I didn’t work in commerce or finance, but I studied it. I worked in marketing. My first 10 years were in marketing. But the three cofounders came from finance; all three were in banking. That’s why I handpicked them, so that we wouldn’t be ignored because we didn’t understand the industry we were getting into.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

	</div>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> As an economic activist now, what is the focus of your activities?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> Communicate economic empowerment. I’ve invested in a micro bakery project that will have a footprint of about 400 bakeries throughout South Africa. It will enable women to generate an income of 5,000 rand a month — about $500 a month — from zero to $500 a month, making their own bread and supplying it to their immediate neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You are an investor in this? You helped to grow the business?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> I am. I’m identifying economic opportunities that can help uplift communities. The first project we’ve done is the bakery. It’s not mine; it’s an existing project that I have invested in to help scale it. I’ve invested in an agricultural project in the southern part of the country in a community that owns land, but didn’t have the resources to invest in seeds. I discovered that seeds for agriculture are the most expensive part. So I invested to enable them to buy the seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In your years of doing this kind of work are there lessons that you’ve learned or that you’ve discovered that are very helpful for scaling these kinds of businesses, for knowing that this bakery is a good idea, it will work and we can scale it?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> I can’t answer that because I’m not operational. I’m an investor. So you would need to talk to people who are operational. I’m sure there must be many lessons. Because when you are pioneering and you are on the ground, you’re responding to issues as they develop. I think the tragedy is that those lessons don’t get documented.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> There’s certainly a lot of interest. To this day you are quite pioneering in bringing women into investing.</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> It hasn’t been done. When we started it, it had never been done and it still hasn’t been done. I’m not sure why because we’ve traveled extensively to share the idea. Somehow people just haven’t been able to get it off the ground. I don’t know whether in our case it was because of the confluence of a change in the political system and people feeling quite optimistic about the future and the opportunities opening up.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> If you were to tell us the typical woman who invested in that fund, who was she?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> What’s actually quite unique about this is that it mobilized South African women from all walks of life. So there were white women, black women, ordinary women, wealthy women, educated women, uneducated women, rural women, urban women. What we did and how we were able to do that is because we invested two years before the company was established doing a roadshow which was called Beyond Labor and Consumption. We felt that all that women were considered good for in the economy was to provide labor, or we consume, we buy. We wanted to take women beyond that to say, you can provide labor and you can consume, but you can also be an investor responsible for your own financial independence.</p>
<p>It was because of that roadshow. It took us about two years. We have nine provinces in South Africa and it went to every single province and spoke to women from all walks of life.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> I would imagine that there would be a barrier with married women feeling like they couldn’t invest their family’s wealth, that the men controlled it or the men had to approve. Did you have to win over the men as well?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> We actually had men who bought shares for their wives and their daughters and their helpers. South Africa is fortunate. We are lucky that we have help in our homes. So we had a lot of white families who actually bought shares for their helpers as well. So we really mobilized the nation and people got behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What are the sort of challenges and opportunities that you’re seeing now for women entrepreneurs in South Africa?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> I think it’s the same issues as everywhere else: access to capital, to expertise, the knowhow, the ecosystem. South Africa doesn’t have an ecosystem for entrepreneurs. Although we have a well-established financial services sector, it doesn’t support entrepreneurs. It’s totally risk averse.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It mobilized South African women from all walks of life. So there were white women, black women, ordinary women, wealthy women, educated women, uneducated women, rural women, urban women.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We don’t have a venture capital culture. There is an element of angel investing, but it’s still very limited. We have private equity, but private equity doesn’t invest in start-ups. So we have pockets of things. We have lots of government funding, but it doesn’t really reach the opportunities that are in the marketplace because we lack the ecosystem. They just don’t know how to assess projects and opportunities and risks. The funds usually go unspent. They don’t go where they are supposed to go to because of that lack of an ecosystem in the economy.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> But somehow you broke through this many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> It was because we were right at the beginning, before there were rules and laws and things. We kind of made it up. Sometimes that’s an advantage when there’s nothing in existence, you can make it up.</p>
<p>The empowerment initiatives that existed at the beginning of our democracy were driven by a few individuals who were primarily men. What we started was the first one that mobilized large numbers of individuals, with a focus on women obviously in our case. That was an example of what I think the government intended with economic empowerment, to make it broad based in a meaningful way.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Are there any key skillsets or talents or abilities that you feel you had to employ to be successful in this?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> Well, three of my cofounders came from the banking sector, so they understood what we were trying to do. We were offering a solution in a sector that we understood. They were known in the industry and they understood the industry.</p>
<p>What I didn’t tell you is that we did two capital raisings from the women themselves. The first was 25 million rand. We needed to do a second one and raised 75 million rand. The first 100 million rand to get this company off the ground and to acquire equity in the various industries came from women themselves. Because of that, by the time we raised institutional funding we had already proven the concept.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Where do you see your work taking you over the next five years?</p>
<p><strong>Luhabe:</strong> I’m beginning to invest in Africa. I’m going to invest in the food business in Kenya. I’m going to invest in Nigeria. I’m going to begin investing outside South Africa.</p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/121504_predictingmarket1.jpg" alt=""></p><p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Investors, consumers and businesses have had a fair share of concerns in 2004: high fuel prices, less-than-stellar job growth and volatile swings in the stock market, which remains well below the highs set four years ago. But by many measures the year is ending well. Oil prices dropped in December, hiring has picked up, and the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500, thanks to a string of gains in the fall, returned nearly 8% from the start of the year through mid-December. </p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Will the good news continue in 2005? The smart money says the coming year will probably bring decent, but not terrific, gains in economic growth and stock prices, according to four Wharton professors. But they do see hazards in the deepening federal and current-accounts deficits and the falling dollar.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">“I think it looks reasonably good,” said Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeremysiegel.com/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a>, referring to the economy and stock markets. “I think we can have 3½% to 4% real growth [in gross domestic product], with very moderate inflation – 2 ½%.”</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Corporate leaders recently polled by the Business Roundtable survey have similar expectations, forecasting 3.5% GDP growth in 2005. Similarly, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/santomea.html">Anthony M. Santomero</a>, a Wharton professor on leave to serve as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, has forecast 3.5% to 4% GDP growth in 2005, compared to the 3.75% he expects for 2004.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Wharton finance and economics professor <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~marstonr/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/marstonr/" target="_blank">Richard Marston</a> says he, too, expects GDP to grow 3.5% to 4% in 2005. “That’s a healthy economy in its middle stage of expansion.” Corporate profits, he added, are not likely to grow as fast on a percentage basis as they have this year, because 2004’s strong profits provide a higher base for comparison. In 2004, it was comparatively easy for businesses to show big gains over the weak earnings of 2003.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Siegel predicts the stock market will produce average gains next year. “I can see returns in the normal range of 6 to 10%.” Bond prices could well fall, he cautioned, if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, as expected. “I think the Fed will continue to raise rates and probably will get to something like 3½% by the end of<span>  </span>[2005].” On December 14, the Fed ordered its fifth hike of the year, lifting short-term rates to 2.25%, up from 1% last summer.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Siegel expects the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to rise to 5%, from the current 4.14%, by the end of 2005. That will push mortgage rates up ½ to 1 percentage point. Marston agreed, arguing that a Fed Funds rate of 2.25% is not high enough to head off rising inflation, now at about 2% (or 3.2% with food and energy costs included). The Fed rate needs to be above 3%, he said, adding that he remains “positive. I think the economy’s under control. It’s not expanding at a pace where [Fed chairman Alan] Greenspan is getting worried. I think the economy is healthy and people are starting to get jobs.”</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Not Many Surprises</span></b></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">According to Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/blume.html">Marshall E. Blume</a>, although investors are unlikely to enjoy 1990s-style gains in stocks in 2005, they probably won’t suffer the deep plunges that have characterized the markets in recent years. “What you’re looking at for the future – for the next year or so – is slow, steady growth. The risk levels in the market are low. What that means is there’s probably not going to be a lot of volatility. There are not a lot of surprises out there.”</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">The price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 has fallen to a relatively safe level in the high teens or low 20s, depending on which earnings accounting is used, he said. That makes stocks a lot safer than when they were trading at 30 to 40 times annual earnings a few years ago. In addition, investors’ assessment of risk is evident in premiums, or prices paid, for stock options. Those prices have fallen considerably, indicating less perceived risk, Blume noted.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">“Equity markets have really come a long way in such a short period of time, with the S&amp;P 500 up 6.1% since the November election and 12.9% since the recent August 12, 2004 lows,” Howard Silverblatt, chief stock analyst for S&amp;P, wrote in a<span>  </span>Dec. 14 report to investors. “As a result, some profit taking can be expected in the near-term.” The long-term outlook, he said, “still remains positive, but slow and most likely bumpy.” He said S&amp;P forecasts a 10.5% gain in operating earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies in 2005, with that index returning 10.1%. Silverblatt forecasts returns averaging as high as 12% a year through 2009.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Siegel predicts job growth will average a fairly healthy rate of about 200,000 jobs a month next year. The economy added about 112,000 jobs in November, disappointing economists who had forecast twice as many after some 300,000 jobs were created in October. The economy must add 100,000 to 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with growth in the labor force.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Analysts say high prices for oil and other commodities made companies reluctant to hire in November. Oil has since fallen to around $41, from around $55 in late October. Another positive sign for job seekers came in a recent Labor Department report that worker productivity in the quarter ended Sept. 30 grew at the slowest rate in two years, at an annual rate of 1.8%, versus 3.8% in the previous quarter. As employers lose their ability to squeeze more production out of their workers, they will be forced to hire if they are to increase production.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Possible Derailment</span></b></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Despite the positive economic signs and market gains of the fall, several problems could derail the recovery next year.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">For example, while Fed interest rate hikes are meant to slow borrowing and reduce spending to curtail inflation, a spike in rates caused by bond-market jitters could reduce consumer and business spending too much. In addition, in recent years the vibrant housing market has helped sustain the economy. But economists at the University of California, Los Angeles, recently forecast a drop in housing starts next year, due to high prices and rising interest rates. Millions of Americans have taken adjustable-rate mortgages on their homes; they will see their monthly payments rise in tandem with the Fed moves, leaving those households with less spending money.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/musto.html"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/musto/" target="_blank">David Musto</a> said higher mortgage rates, falling home prices, or both, could have ripple effects that are not well understood. People stuck with homes that are not worth as much as they owe, and people worried about the high payments they would face with new mortgages, might opt to stay put rather than take new jobs. “People migrating to their most productive use is, of course, good for the economy,” he said. “If they are not doing that … we will see if that turns out to be a serious thing.”</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Beyond the other obvious hazards – a worsening situation in Iraq or a major terror attack on the U.S – Marston worries about the danger that the dollar will continue falling against foreign currencies.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">A low dollar helps American companies sell goods and services abroad by making them cheaper to foreign buyers. But the U.S. also relies on foreigners for loans, in the form of Treasury bond purchases, which make American deficit spending possible.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">As the dollar becomes less valuable, foreign investors, including governments in China, Japan and elsewhere, could worry that they are losing money on Treasuries. Should they reverse course and start selling Treasuries, the dollar would fall further. To attract investors, Treasury-bond yields would then have to rise, causing interest rates for mortgages and other loans to go up as well, dampening U.S. economic growth. “I think the dollar is a concern,” Marston said.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">The fate of the dollar is tied to two worsening deficits. The federal budget deficit results from the government spending more than it is taking in. The current account deficit is caused when Americans – their government included – spend more than they earn, financing the difference with loans from foreigners.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">To avert a damaging slide in the dollar the government must tackle the two deficits, and the key to that is to reduce the federal budget deficit, Marston said. The current level of foreign financing of U.S. debt is “not sustainable,” heightening the risk of a depreciation in the dollar. Now that the U.S. is in economic recovery, “the government ought to straighten out this fiscal deficit.” </p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Greenspan also has argued the budget deficit must be tackled. President Bush promised during the campaign to cut the deficit in half in four years, but he also has proposed further tax cuts as well as making permanent the temporary cuts enacted in his first term. His proposal to let workers invest part of their Social Security contributions in personal accounts could force the government to borrow trillions to meet obligations to people in or near retirement.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Most analysts are also keeping a close eye on oil prices. Another surge in oil would increase business expenses, undermining profits and thus hurting stock prices. High gasoline and heating oil prices can cut into consumer spending, hurting corporate profits and economic growth. Indeed, Wal-Mart and some other large retailers have reported disappointing holiday sales as consumers pay around $2 a gallon for gasoline.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">In a Nov. 16 speech at Carnegie Mellon University, the Fed’s Santomero said that “the underlying fundamentals of long-run supply and demand will keep oil prices from declining substantially for the foreseeable future. And, given the many sources of instability in the countries that supply much of the world’s oil, we must recognize the possibility of another spike in oil prices as a significant risk.”</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana"></p><span style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: verdana">Finally, there is, as always, the prospect for unanticipated events to upset all the experts’ forecasts – natural disasters, political crisis, war. As Siegel noted: “Very rarely do we see these things coming.”</span>

						<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2690" src="http://d29rnz06qthrny.cloudfront.net/today/files/2012/01/Wharton-Economic-Forum.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="218">In a keynote speech at the first Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) to be held outside Philadelphia, ICICI Bank and Infosys chairman, K.V. Kamath predicted that the next ten years will be a “game changer” for India. At the conference in Mumbai, Kamath and other speakers discussed India’s growth in recent years, and what is needed to spur further economic expansion.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of that growth, according to Kamath, is, unlike in the 1990s, there is more internal resource mobilization. Some 65% of the economy today does not need borrowing from abroad to fund growth. To hike this percentage further, Kamath suggested that it is necessary to integrate the 600 million Indians who do not have bank accounts into the mainstream. Financial inclusion is vital, he noted, and it is the responsibility of not just the government, but corporate India as well.</p>
<p>Kamath, who led ICICI’s transformation from a development financial institution to a bank, does not agree with those who claim that the Indian banking sector is in poor shape. The fears expressed over the levels of non-performing assets were unwarranted, he said, and GDP growth numbers do not capture all sectors. His comments were echoed by Vinay Rai, the country’s comptroller and auditor general: “When the world is growing at 2%, we are growing at 7%,” Rai noted. “We have clearly moved away from the Hindu rate of growth of 3% to 4%. Right now, all indicators are improving.”</p>
<p>But the country is not without problems. Speakers at a panel discussion on “Financing the Growth of India” said that getting government permissions for any project remains a monumental task. One idea floated was the creation of a Union ministry for infrastructure. But the consensus was that such an entity might lead to even more gridlock. For one, there is no accepted definition of the word “infrastructure.” Lalit Jalan, CEO of Reliance Infrastructure, noted that a project could be cleared in two years in one city, but take four years in another, making it difficult for companies to plan or allocate resources.</p>
<p>There are other burdens facing Indian industry, said Surjit Bhalla, chairman of OxUS Investment and the moderator of the panel. “India pays the highest in the world for labor, for capital and for energy.” If just one of these factors were to improve, he noted, there would be a big impact on growth.</p>
<p>According to Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, there is no magic wand to wave to solve these problems. “We are an argumentative democracy,” she said. “As a democracy, we cannot write out three prescriptions and say this is the solution.” Many of today’s worries are mainly affecting big companies, she added. “Go to the rural areas or small and medium enterprises and you will get a different picture,” she said.</p>

In her book, </em>Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist<em>, Raworth encourages careful consideration of measurements beyond the standard gross domestic product metric. Thoughtful economic planning, in her view, should include health and well-being, the environment and other factors important to quality of life. She spoke with Knowledge@Wharton about her “doughnut” view of  more holistic economic distribution, and why it holds so much benefit for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>An edited transcript of the conversation follows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> In the modern world, it seems there are new ideas on so many topics every day, so what is the problem when we’re thinking about economies and growth?</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><strong>Kate Raworth:</strong> You say there are new ideas on each and every thing every day, and there are, especially in technology and biology and so many fields that are evolving so fast. But if you’re a student going to university to study economics today, you are going to be one of the policy leaders, one of the thinkers of the 21<sup>st</sup> century shaping this world in 2050. But I believe students today are still being taught economics that come out of the textbooks of 1950, based on the theories of 1850. Given the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, from climate change to extreme inequality to repeated financial crises, this is shaping up to be a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Your book offers this mountaintop view of the world. One central idea is that gross domestic product is an ineffective way to measure an economy because it’s only one-dimensional. Could you talk about that?</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> I feel so sorry for Simon Kuznets because back in the 1930s he was asked by Congress to come up with a measure of national income. He did a fantastic job and came up with this measure, which we now know as GDP. But at the time when he created it, he gave us a caveat. He said, “This measure should in no way be mistaken for the measure of a nation’s welfare.” Did we listen? No. Kuznets said “It doesn’t include all the incredible valuable unpaid caring work of parents, all that cooking, washing, sweeping, cleaning, raising the kids that’s done every day. It doesn’t include the value of communities and the things that communities produce and do for each other that doesn’t show up in the national economy. It’s just a flow measure. We’ve got to also look at the stocks, what’s happening to the underlying financial capital, but also natural and social and human capital.”</p>
<p>He saw this was a very thin measure and gave us a caveat. It got ignored because there’s nothing like the temptation of a single number for policymakers to latch onto. When you can measure one country’s growth over years, but also compare it to other countries, then you’re in some sort of competition that we’ve not been able to let go of for over 80 years. It’s just too narrow a measure. And I think we’ve become addicted over those 80 years to this Peter Pan idea that an economy is doing better if it’s always growing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Students today are still being taught economics that come out of the textbooks of 1950, based on the theories of 1850.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We need to ask ourselves three questions. Growth from what? Is the economy growing because we’re making a huge investment in a transition to renewable energies, like China investing $360 billion by 2020 in solar energy capacity? That’s a great reason for GDP in China’s growth. Or is it growing because we’ve got massive consumer debt spending on mortgages we can’t afford and cars we don’t need? That is not a great reason for GDP growth.</p>
<p>Second, growth for whom? Is GDP growing because the top 1% are reaping the returns as they have been doing in recent years? Or is GDP growing because income is going to people who live below the poverty line, enabling them for the first time to meet life’s essentials?</p>
<p>And thirdly, growth until when? If GDP is growing for good reasons, then at what point will it have reached its optimal size so that we grow into thriving balance like everything in nature does? How much solar energy capacity do we need until we can make the most of what the sunshine offers us? How much should we be investing in, say, expanding schools and investing in teachers so that every kid has a good start in life? In nature, everything grows until it reaches its optimal size. We should ask those same kinds of questions in our economies, too.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> An example I’ve heard is that if you picture someone stuck in traffic for an hour, they’re burning up gasoline. This causes GDP to go up. But there’s no measure taken of the person’s time lost in traffic or of the pollutants being released, which cause health care costs to go up and worsen climate change. We’re not taking into account the costs. It seems like that’s the balance that you’re going for.</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> Right. GDP essentially only measures things that carry a price, so all those other things that you described are called externality in economics because they fall outside of the market transaction. Well, if you’re going to call impact from the living world and the health of people an externality, you’ve already told me how important you think it isn’t. That’s a fundamental problem with the way economics has been framed. If you don’t bring the living world and communities into how we understand managing our household in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, because that’s what economics means, we don’t give ourselves a chance for thriving.</p>
<p>Even when people do try to take these things into account, they sometimes come up with a statistic that says, for example, if people are dying 10 years younger because of pollution, how much of their working life is lost? Sometimes they’ll even say we’re losing their contribution to GDP. It’s this topsy-turvy world in which we sometimes try and justify the most valuable things in life, like health and well-being, in terms of a lost ability to contribute to the economy. We’ve got a situation where human well-being is apparently in service to the economy, where we need to turn that around. The economy, and certainly the financial sector, should be in service to life. We need to reframe it. I think that’s partly why we need new statistics, new data, new metrics that take away this concentration on everything being expressed in terms of money and what it does for our economy. We need to measure it in their own terms — life expectancy, people’s well-being, the stability of the climate, the health of the soil, the health of the oceans — not monetizing everything.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You think that the recession could have been more of a wakeup call for thinking about economies and growth around the world, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> Yes. Of course, it shook the global economy. But it also shook the confidence of economists. Certainly in the U.K., where I come from, the queen asked economists at the London School of Economics why did nobody see it coming. And everybody ran scampering, frantic to be able to answer the queen.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>They didn’t see it coming because it wasn’t written into the models. The inherent instability wasn’t reflected in the models. Even the Bank of England and all students were being taught a model of economics that didn’t reflect accurately where money comes from. It didn’t reflect accurately the interconnection and, therefore, the vulnerability of the banking networks. So, they weren’t taking a systems view or a complexity view of the economy. This did shake up economics.</p>
<p>My concern is, it just shook up economics to respond to the financial problems. We have lots of people saying it’s time for new economics. But I worry that too much of that has been concerned about needing new economic thinking so that we get finance right.</p>
<p>What about bringing in the living world? What about bringing in human well-being? We need just not a rethinking of financial economics, we’ve got to bring in ecological and feminist and behavioral and complexity economics. The wonderful thing is that when you bring in these other perspectives, it gets so much more interesting. It gets so much more grounded in reality. Young people who’ve signed up to study economics, their eyes light up because they say, “Now I feel I’m actually studying the world around me. This makes sense to me. I feel like I’m getting an education that will equip me for the future that I can see is coming.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s nothing like the temptation of a single number for policymakers to latch onto.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You still have the hurdle of trying to get it moved through. I think it gets blocked by politics in this country and other places around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> When you bring in a new language and a new framing of the world, of course you run into barriers. Then we get into the really interesting places, the political resistance to paradigm change. When Copernicus realized that universe did not move around an unmoving earth, when he realized that the sun was at the center of our solar system, the Catholic church spent centuries refusing to listen to what he said. Paradigm change is very, very threatening for those who are benefiting from the current state of the way things are. It’s politicians, and I think particularly companies and financial power, who benefit from excluding the living world from our concerns, excluding people’s health and leaving these things as externalities.</p>
<p>I think as citizens and as people who are smart to the challenges ahead of us, it’s our responsibility to start speaking a new language and to reframe the economy in a way that actually takes care of 21<sup>st</sup> century concerns. That’s what so many students around the world are doing. The great irony is that economics has managed to rile its very student body. The people who signed up with debt and years of their lives to study theories of economics are turning around and critiquing what they’re being taught because they know it’s not equipping them for the future. We’ve got to transform the teaching of economics in universities and schools, but also create a language that politicians can feel comfortable with. It is a responsibility on those of us advocating new economics to help put it in a language that makes sense to public and that politicians can start to use.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What would it look like to make major changes in the way that you suggest? You mentioned in your book “strong contractions of industries such as mining, oil and gas, industrial livestock production, demolition and landfill, and speculative finance.” It’s a tall order that would devastate a lot of livelihoods. There would have to be a big transition period, and there would be winners and losers. How would all that work?</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> That’s absolutely right. There are winners and loser in the economy every day, and there are winners and losers from the massive technological shifts that are going on right now. All the time, the economy is evolving. We just need to ask ourselves, what is the purpose of the economy and what direction do we want it to evolve in?</p>
<p>I think there are two principles that we need to put at the heart of the 21<sup>st</sup> century economy that actually has a chance of meeting the needs of all within the means of the planet. The first is to create an economy that’s distributive by design. By that I mean an economy in which value that’s created, and the benefits of that value are shared far more equitably with everyone who helped to create it. Think employee-owned companies, where the profits created by the company are shared amongst all those who helped create that value, rather than a shareholder-run company where the profits go off to fickle and often distant shareholders who never even set foot on the premises. We need economies that are distributive by design.</p>
<p>But they also need to be regenerative by design. By which I mean we need to think about our relationship to the living world on which we depend. We need to create industries that use resources again and again rather than using them up. We shouldn’t be landfilling plastic. We should recognize it’s an extraordinarily rare and valuable resource that we need to be smart and innovative in using again and again.</p>
<p>As we go on that path to making economies that are distributive and regenerative by design, that creates so many jobs. In the U.S., there are four times more jobs in renewable industries than there are in the mining industry. We need to look to that future, find ways of creating jobs there, and you have to look for those who are losing in transition and work with them.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Your example about plastic is an interesting one. In the U.S., we’re working to make progress on that. Those kind of changes tend to lead to finding cheaper ways to do things. It can increase profits if you can find a way to cut costs. How could the political and lobbying efforts that would be lodged against these kinds of moves be challenged? Or what might work to help move things along in the direction you’d like to see it go?</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> Let’s stick with the plastics example. Some governments around the world, particularly countries that have a tourist sector and are famed for their beautiful beaches and villages, are realizing that by allows plastics to accumulate they have destroyed the very assets for which people have come to visit their country. The government smartly said, “We ban the use of plastic bags. We ban the use of single plastics.” What you need is smart governmental regulation that gives a legal and a loud signal to industry, saying within five or 10 years this is going to be banned. Industrialists know well in advance, and they can start planning for it right now.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that once that message is in place — surprise, surprise — industry just adapts because the incentive is clear, the change in marketplace is clear. Over time, they just move to work with it. Sometimes it comes top down from the government. But sometimes it comes bottom up from people, the citizens saying, “We’ve just discussed it and we’ve had enough.” They refuse plastic bags in a shop, and it comes from a citizens’ pressure.</p>
<p>We need those two things to work together because the power of lobbying to resist either of those, the lobby power of companies putting money in government pocket to prevent them from making changes, is so strong that we need to get that corporate money out of politics, return it to the democratic space, but also enable people and governments to shift the economy in the right direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think we’ve become addicted to this Peter Pan idea that an economy is doing better if it’s always growing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many companies also desperately trying to move in that right direction because there are many good people working with a progressive vision who want to make companies be part of the progressive future. We need to work with those progressive companies and help them convince governments that they should move forward with the progressives, rather than being held back by the money of those who are benefiting from the situation as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Do you think as millennials and Generation Z get older and take more leadership positions, not only in corporations but in government, we’ll be able to see a lot of this change?</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> I hope we will. But I really worry because they are still being taught economics out of the 1950s textbooks. Let me give you an example. If you say to an economist, “Show me the biggest picture you have of the economy.” Economics means household management. So show me the household, show me the whole thing. The picture they can show you was drawn by Paul Samuelson in 1948, and economists call it the Circular Flow Diagram. It shows how money goes around and around the economy between households and business, flows through government, flows through the finance sector and goes through trade. There’s absolutely no mention of the living world. No mention of unpaid worker parents. No mention of the commons. Students are still having that mindset, that image of what the economy is, put in their heads by the textbook.</p>
<p>If we don’t equip them with a mental imagery, a language and a framework that help them see the whole 21<sup>st</sup> century, we are massively undermining future leaders. I’m really concerned that they are not getting this education yet.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You’d like to replace it with the picture of a doughnut, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> The doughnut has a purpose. The hole in the middle is the space where people are falling short on life’s essentials, be it food and water, health care, political voice. We’ve got to get everybody out of that hole in the doughnut. But we mustn’t go over the outer crust because there we’re overshooting pressure on the planet, causing climate change, biodiversity loss, acidifying the ocean. Our well-being lies in personal health, but also planetary health, the space within the doughnut itself. No one falling short and we’re not overshooting.</p>
<p>If I could shape what’s the first picture you’d ever show a brand-new student of economics, I’d show them a diagram that’s in my book that I call the embedded economy. It shows the economy embedded in society, embedded in the living world.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Paradigm change is very, very threatening for those who are benefiting from the current state of the way things are.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We already recognize economy is a dependent subsystem of society and the world, but also that the economy has four essential provisioning sectors. Yes, it’s got the market and the state. They dominated some kind of 20<sup>th</sup> century ideological boxing match. And in that domination, they’ve squeezed out the household, the space of unpaid caring work where we all begin every day, but also the commons. Every economic student learns about that. Economist Elinor Ostrom had made clear that under the right conditions and governance, you can have a triumph of the commons.</p>
<p>I think every student should learn there are four fundamental forms of provisioning: through market exchange, through the state providing public goods, through household unpaid care and households and communities, and the self-organizing without market or state in the commons. Almost any good that you care to think of can be provided in any one of those four ways. Then you’ve got a much more interesting start, saying when is each of these provisioning systems actually the best way? How can they work together, the commons and the market? The commons and the state? The market and the state? Give these economic students that start, and they will come up with such better innovations for this century.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Is there anywhere in the world where that kind of system is working? Or maybe it’s an industry or a company?</p>
<p><strong>Raworth:</strong> Great question. What excites me is when I get contacted by companies and cities that say, “We love this doughnut because it gives us a blueprint for where we want to get to.” I was contacted by some urban developers in Stockholm who are developing a new district. They said, “We want to create the world’s most livable city district. How do we meet the needs of all the residents for food and water and health care and transport and energy within the means of the planet, respecting the ecosystem within which it’s nested?”</p>
<p>I also got contacted by people in KwaZulu-Natal, the fastest-growing area in South Africa, saying “We’ve used this to re-envision the future for our town.” The youth in the city say, “We want to add in fun, too. It’s got to be fun transforming your economy. Companies from Mars to Patagonia have said to me, “We are using this to rethink our strategy. We know we’re not in the doughnut yet, but at least it gives us a compass for asking ourselves how do we ensure that the way that we do business and make profit is helping humanity move into that safe and just space, rather than pushing us out of it.”</p>
<p>I can’t name a country yet. I’ve only just launched this book, and I’m only just beginning these conversations. I wouldn’t want to name a country before I could give it the doughnut stamp of approval. But I can see there’s interest because governments are struggling to find a vision of the future that actually makes sense to public. The growth horse, I think, has been beaten to a flank. We need a new vision of a regenerative economy.</p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2002/11/672_0.jpg" alt=""></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The economy may not be recovering as strongly as some would like. But it is healthy enough at the moment that the Bush administration does not need to accelerate existing tax cuts or push for new cuts to stimulate economic activity, according to professors of finance and public policy at Wharton. They also say that the reemergence of federal budget deficits is reason enough to forego thinking about tax cuts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In wide-ranging interviews, in which they discussed what they think the administration s economic agenda should be for the next two years, faculty members also said that heightened terrorist activity and an invasion of </span><span>Iraq</span><span> hold the potential to unsettle the </span><span>U.S.</span><span> economy and swell government spending. But they noted that if a war with </span><span>Iraq</span><span> ended quickly, and if terrorism were held to a minimum, the economy would probably be much improved in time for the 2004 election campaign.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> I m not enthusiastic about accelerating the income-tax cuts, says finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeremysiegel.com/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a>.  They won t do much to spur the economy. In any event, he adds,  My feeling is that President Bush won t get the tax cuts he wants because of Democratic opposition.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Siegel says the current recovery is proceeding at a healthy pace compared to the last time the country emerged from recession.  We had a sluggish recovery from the last recession 10 years ago, and this recovery is stronger than that, he explains. Some economists feel that lagging job growth indicates a weak recovery, but Siegel notes that job creation is slow only because productivity is  particularly strong. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Siegel estimates that when the government issues a revised figure for the nation s gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter, it will show that the economy is growing at an annual rate of 4%. That figure is to be released in late November.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> I m pretty dubious about this tax-cut business, says <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/faulhabe.html"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/faulhabe/" target="_blank">Gerald Faulhaber</a>, professor of business and public policy and management.  I think we went overboard on tax cuts. We ended up with surpluses at the end of the </span><span>Clinton</span><span> era as a result of the long boom we had. Bush came in to cut taxes because that was part of his agenda. But now the boom is over and nobody is predicting surpluses. We have a war on terrorism and a possible war with </span><span>Iraq</span><span>. We ll probably have a long-term presence in </span><span>Iraq</span><span> [if a war is waged and won], all of which is expensive. And, at the same time, the elderly want a prescription plan. How are we going to pay for that? The notion of more tax cuts is reckless, to tell you the truth. If we want this stuff, we should pay for it. We shouldn t leave it to our grandchildren. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>According to finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/souleles.html"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/souleles/" target="_blank">Nicholas Souleles</a>, the administration will have to decide whether its goal is short-term stimulus or long-term growth because each goal requires different policy approaches.  If the focus is on short-term stimulus, you could consider short-term spending or tax cuts, Souleles explains.  But for purposes of long-term growth, you might not want to increase government spending because that could raise interest rates and so crowd out private-sector investment. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Targeted Tax Cuts</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Souleles also says that lower-income households are likely to spend more of a given tax cut, so if the goal is to stimulate the economy, the administration could consider targeting tax cuts disproportionately to low-income people. In addition, people are likely to spend more of a tax cut if the cut is permanent.  They figure they don t need to save that first tax cut because they know they re going to get more tax relief in the future. So in terms of a spending kick, permanent tax cuts should have a bigger effect. But permanent tax cuts could continue to crowd out long-term growth. There are trade-offs involved in decisions like these. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Adds finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~allenf/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/allenf/" target="_blank">Franklin Allen</a>:  The administration shouldn t run up a huge deficit. That should be their priority. Allen says the administration should take note of what has happened to </span><span>Japan</span><span> in the last decade.  </span><span>Japan</span><span> was in a strong position fiscally but their asset bubble burst in the early 1990s. In the mid-1990s tax revenues went way down and that s when </span><span>Japan</span><span> started on this debt binge they re still on. When people say,  The U.S. won t make the same mistake, that s when I get really worried. The administration s view is that the current budget deficit is a short-run problem and that the country can afford to borrow for a couple of years [until a faster-growing economy starts to produce more tax revenue]. I don t think it is a short-term problem. I d rather see us in fiscal balance than running up deficits. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Bush tax-cut plan that was enacted last year, coupled with the collapse in stock prices and a recession, left the government with a deficit of $159 billion for fiscal year 2002, which ended Sept. 30. An even bigger deficit is expected for fiscal 2003. Looking further out, burgeoning deficits would make it harder for the government to deal with long-term problems related to Social Security and Medicare, according to the faculty members. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan recently warned that  continuous large deficits would risk returning to an era of high interest rates, low levels of investment and slower growth of productivity. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>One positive way to look at the deficit is that the shortfall for fiscal 2002 stood at 1.5% of GDP, much lower than the 5% and 6% levels of the mid-1980s. But if the government spends billions on a war in </span><span>Iraq</span><span> and on counter-terrorism efforts, that percentage could rise in a hurry.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Siegel predicts the </span><span>United States</span><span> is unlikely to enter another recession. He does say, however, that growth will slow down in the fourth quarter because consumers have already spent a lot of money this year on durable goods, which are products expected to last three years or more.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Federal Reserve, Siegel added, acted properly earlier this month when it lowered the federal funds rate one half of a percentage point, to 1.25%, to spur economic activity. Furthermore, it was right for the Fed to signal that it would take back that half point if the economy improves significantly. At the same time, the Fed has room to cut rates again if the economy does not respond the way the Fed thinks it should.  I d rather see [a cut in interest rates] rather than a tax cut, Siegel notes. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>The Deflation Debate</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>But Siegel thinks the half-point cut may be enough.  I fully believe the Fed, in lowering interest rates and pushing liquidity in the markets, will have a positive effect on the economy next year. The fourth quarter is tough but I don t see that as a prelude to a collapse in consumer spending. The Fed could go to zero, but it wouldn t go there unless the economy really started faltering. Christmas spending would have to be disappointing and in January we d have to see slippage in other indicators. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Siegel forecasts that inflation will creep up to 2% or 3% in the next couple of years. He discounts fears of deflation in the </span><span>United States</span><span>, saying,  No deflation is in the offing. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Allen and Faulhaber, though, suggest that deflation  widespread, persistent declines in prices  is a possibility in the </span><span>United States</span><span>. They note that </span><span>Japan</span><span> has been struggling unsuccessfully to boost economic growth since the early 1990s, even with interest rates at zero percent.  We need to worry about deflation, Faulhaber says.  The stock market is still somewhat overvalued and there s a mini-bubble in the property market. A further decline in stock and real estate prices would add fuel to the argument that deflation could be in the offing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> I worry more about deflation than most people, both in the </span><span>United States</span><span> and globally, adds Allen.  Anyone who s shopped for a TV lately has noticed that prices have been falling. You can buy a really nice TV for $200 or $300. It is good that TVs cost less than they used to, he notes, but if prices keep sliding, people may hold off buying goods until prices fall still further. In a deflationary environment wages could decline and jobs could be cut, and consumers would have greater difficulty servicing their debt.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>China</span><span> is playing a role in keeping prices down for many mass-produced goods. This comes at a time when the world is experiencing excess industrial capacity.  </span><span>China</span><span> can produce a lot of things cheaply, Allen says.  That puts downward pressure on prices worldwide. It could well cause deflation. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Allen also worries about a collapse in housing prices.  People say home prices on average in the </span><span>U.S.</span><span> haven t fallen since the 1930s, but I think we re closer to the 1930s than one would think. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Siegel, however, disagrees.  Housing will remain strong. Housing prices are high and there are not a lot of bargains out there, but I don t see a crash in real estate. I do not think we are in a generalized bubble. Prices are not excessively high. There are pockets of regional speculation, but speculation [was more rampant] earlier this year than it is now. I think we re seeing a cooling off of the housing market. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>There is one area where Siegel would like to see tax relief: elimination of the double taxation on dividends. Dividends are first taxed on the corporate level as earnings and then again when they are received by individual investors. Such a move would not only benefit investors but would help restore confidence in the financial markets in the wake of scandals in corporate </span><span>America</span><span> and on Wall Street.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Siegel believes that dividends should be deductible from the corporate income tax. Others believe it is better to give a tax break to individual investors. Either way, says Siegel, such a move  would help bring back investor confidence. Giving companies an incentive to pay dividends will bear a lot of fruit in the coming years. We re one of the few countries in the world that has no tax break on dividends. That, combined with some other factors, has caused dividends to go out of style and has created a crisis of confidence on the part of investors.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>In an op-ed piece in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> in August, Siegel and two colleagues  Wharton finance professor Andrew Metrick and Harvard finance professor Paul Gompers  described one of the benefits of ending double taxation of dividends.  If dividends were a deductible expense, firms would be strongly motivated to pay out all their profits as dividends, since retained earnings would be subject to the corporate tax, they wrote.  Firms that did not pay dividends would be viewed unfavorably by investors who feared that the earnings are inflated and that the cash does not exist. The payment of cash dividends would therefore add significant credibility to management s earnings reports. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Since eliminating double taxation of would reduce the amount of revenue going to the U.S. Treasury, Siegel proposes that the administration support a trade-off of sorts: rewrite the law governing estate taxes in exchange for a dividend tax break. He says the government could exempt from tax the first $4 million or $5 million of the estate tax.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>By the time 2004 rolls around, Siegel and Faulhaber say President Bush should not be saddled with a deteriorating economy as his father was when he lost a reelection bid to Bill Clinton  as long as a war with </span><span>Iraq</span><span> and activity by Al Qaeda proceed in a way that does not have negative political and economic consequences. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> I think he s going to have a recovering economy; he won t have a rip-roaring economy, says Siegel.  The stock market is going to be firm, but it will take many years to get back to where we were in March of 2000 [when technology and dot-com stocks crashed]. We all know uncertainties are in the cards, like a war with </span><span>Iraq</span><span> that may overwhelm the economy. But at this particular juncture, I think he has a stronger recovery than his father did. <b></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span> </span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Adds Faulhaber:  There are some danger signs around: the possibility of deflation and a housing bubble. And if an Iraqi war goes badly, that wouldn t help. But in a year or so we ll see a rise in the stock market and the economy. Generally speaking, I think it s going to be Bush s election to lose in 2004. </span></p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/216_0.jpg" alt=""><i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Hasung Jang is one of Korea’s leading activists for political reform, particularly through his advocacy group, the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy. Jang, who has a Ph.D. from Wharton, is also director of Korea University’s Center for Finance and Banking and a persistent critic of the economic system that has hobbled Korea’s attempts at economic reform. He has been especially disparaging of the South Korean chaebol, or conglomerates, whose business practices contributed significantly to the economic crisis that nearly destroyed the country in 1997-98.</p><p>With the historic unification talks in June between the leaders of North and South Korea, Jang’s efforts to bring both political and economic reform have become more urgent  and more complicated. In an interview with Knowledge@Wharton, Jang shared his views on the unification process and what it will mean for Korea’s domestic economy as well as the international business community.</p></font></i></p><p></p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: Regarding the recent developments between North and South Korea, do you believe that the North is genuinely interested in unification, or are there underlying political motives involved which need to be considered?</p><b></b><p>Jang: Certainly there are politics involved on both sides. Up until the summit, however, both the North and the South looked at themselves as ‘good’ and their counterpart as ‘evil’. In a sense, neither would acknowledge the other. There is no doubt the people of the South wanted unification but thought that the North Koreans [were not interested]. Now, because of the summit, I believe that the North Korean people are also willing to unite and that their intentions are genuine. </p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: In the event of unification, what will be the impact on the two economies, particularly with regards to South Korea’s technology industries?</p><b></b><p>Jang: Many suggest that Korean unification will put an economic burden on the South. But there are opportunities and benefits as well. I think it’s true that the costs exceed the benefits in the short term, but in the long term, the benefits will far exceed the costs. The North probably has the most disciplined, well-educated labor force. They lack the technologies and knowledge of a market economy but their craving for a better life is no different from that of people in the South. </p><p>It will take quite awhile. In the early stages, the South will have to give something first and not expect to get something in return soon. But if we help North Korea develop their economy and if South Korea is able to achieve high economic growth … in the long run we are all better off.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: How do you think foreign investors will react to unification?</p><b></b><p>Jang: North Korea has one of the worst investment environments. There are no guarantees, no market systems, no banks. International investors have a lot of risks to bear. South Korea must play a role in taking some of those risk burdens off foreign investors’ shoulders, either through government intervention or through the private sector. </p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: What will be the costs of unification in terms of productivity or employment? </p><b></b><p>Jang: In South Korea, unemployment will immediately jump to over 10% or even 20%. And [the fact that] South Korea’s standard of living is now ten times higher, in terms of average income, than the North’s will create social tension between the two.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: Do you think there are similarities between unification in Korea and unification in Germany?</p><b></b><p>Jang: There are many similarities, but there are also many differences. The North Korean regime is much more centralized and more autocratic, and faces worse economic conditions than East Germany. In addition, there has been no form of communication between North and South Korea, unlike East and West Germany.</p><p>In the early stages, I think we will face more problems than did East and West Germany. However, development between North and South Korea is different in the sense that North Korea is now on the verge of economic collapse. It has no other options. It tried very hard to get assistance from the United States and Japan, which ended in failure. South Korea is the only place it can go to ask for help. Certainly it risks losing face or losing internal control, but depending on how things proceed, [unification] can be orchestrated and well planned. </p><p>In addition, the border between East and West Germany collapsed suddenly. Even though West Germany had prepared for that for a long time, it was not in a position to absorb all those shocks. But North Korea is maintaining tight control over its system despite all the economic problems.</p><p>I think we will do better. I don’t think the border will be opened in one day. It will be a much more gradual process.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: Despite talks about unification, South Korean President Kim was unable to win a majority in parliament in April’s elections. So what impact will that have on his agenda for economic policy and reforms in the last three years of his presidential term?</p><b></b><p>Jang: He certainly has less leverage than he did when he was elected. In addition to that, the focus on the North/South summit somehow left the reform process behind. So we are running into another risky situation … </p><p>But this time there are more domestic developments [to rely on]. We have worked hard to reconstruct the financial sector. We have spent half the sum of taxpayers’ money to clean up non-performing loans out of the banks, and we have done a reasonably good job changing laws and regulations governing some of the business structures, particularly corporate governance. However, the chaebol are far stronger than anyone ever thought, so all this reform effort hasn’t really crossed the river of no return yet. In other words, it can always roll back if the government loses its leverage. This is particularly true because many of the reforms we have accomplished in the last two-and-a-half years were done under government pressure rather than market pressure. And the market hasn’t yet fully developed in a way to build up its own self-functioning system. So if [President Kim] loses his political leverage then reform may [suffer].</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: How critical is it for Kim to form a coalition government?</p><b></b><p>Jang: That’s probably what he’ll have to do. Unfortunately, unlike at the beginning of his government, no matter how the coalition government is formed, it won’t be as effective as it was at the beginning of his term.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: Until the market is in full force, what needs to change?</p><b></b><p>Jang: Let’s start by looking at the causes of this crisis. Then we may find a solution. Banks lost credit in the international financial community for two reasons: First, they didn’t have the reserves to pay back short-term debt; second, they were sitting on top of a huge amount of non-performing loans, which was a problem many in the foreign investment community thought could be fixed. But after the fall of Kia Motors, investors began to believe that South Korea didn’t have the self-correcting functions to clean up the mess in the financial institutions, particularly in the commercial banks. </p><p>There are two kinds of bank borrowers, households and corporations. We now have only a few retail banks, those that engage in household lending, but all of these are coming out very strong, including Hana Bank and Korea Housing Bank. </p><p>So the root causes of this crisis come from the corporate sector which has lost its competitiveness. … The international market has cut off all credit lines from foreign banks. That has spread into foreign exchange rates … reserves have dried up. So unless we really do a job restructuring the corporate sector, particularly the chaebol, no amount of taxpayer money poured into the banks and financial sector will fix the problem. Every month we come up with new non-performing loans, which are getting bigger and bigger. And then people begin to wonder why things aren’t getting better.</p><p>Yes, the economy is coming back very strong, but if you look at the figures, only those who have done a reasonable restructuring job at the early stage of the crisis are [doing well]. All those who haven’t done anything, such as Hyundai Group, are creating more headaches. So we have to fix those structural problems in the corporate sector, particularly in the chaebol. </p><p>Before the crisis, chaebol never failed, not because they were profitable, but because sister companies were helping them out. Even today, some of Hyundai Group company’s operating income is not enough to cover its interest payments. And it is still operating. </p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: What about the impact of the small and mid-sized enterprises?</p><b></b><p>Jang: Chaebol restructuring in the end should produce an economic system where small and medium-sized enterprises play a role at least equivalent to the role of the chaebol. One of the most harmful aspects of the chaebol structure has been the absence of more creative entrepreneurs. If the chaebol saw even a small opportunity, they jumped into it because they already have everything in place: human resources, money, connections, networks. You can hardly find an industry in which a chaebol is not dominant, including advertising. Samsung has 60 affiliated companies. They say, "Why would we give these jobs to anyone else? Why don’t we do it?" They see opportunities in department stores or distribution channels … They make automobiles, ships, television sets, flour, sugar, cosmetics. You name it.</p><p>Sony alone is bigger than Samsung’s whole group. While Sony is doing electronics-related businesses, Samsung is doing everything from hotels to airplanes. When you say you can do everything, it means that there’s not even one thing you can do the best. They are not specialized. I’m not saying that specialization is the best strategy for the companies, but if they are in 30 different kinds of businesses, I don’t think they can be competitive in the international community.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: But the chaebol have no incentive to change.</p><b></b><p>Jang: That’s the problem. The controlling families have no incentive to change … I don’t expect we can achieve chaebol reform in a few years, It will be a continuous process, but developing capital markets will be the fastest way to do it.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: What will be the single, most effective way to change the chaebol?</p><b></b><p>Jang: A hostile takeover. I haven’t seen a single hostile takeover yet in Korea. I’m dreaming of a company taking over a big chaebol company through a tender offer in the market, which would wake up everyone at once. It will certainly shape up the chaebol.</p><b></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: Once Korea’s markets are open, won’t companies have to specialize in order to survive?</p><b></b><p>Jang: Yes, in which case small and medium-sized companies can play a bigger role … In the area of Internet and telecommunications technologies, for example, very strong new small-sized companies are growing and gaining footage.</p><p>Since the 1997-98 crisis, we have had many new companies. Just look at the Kosdaq. There’s a question as to how inflated their valuations are, but that’s not what’s important to me. To me, what is important is that these companies started their businesses. The crisis opened new doors.</p><b></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: You’re working hard to get shareholders to understand their rights.</p><b></b><p>Jang: The corporation is an economic form of a democracy … When the controlling family takes money out of the company, even the owner of just ten shares can complain and file a suit against them. Now that the Korean economy is on the verge of getting into developed markets, even blue collar workers are accumulating wealth. Everyone now has some savings and investment, so it’s not just about consumers’ rights or workers’ rights. [People] are more concerned about protecting their own wealth in stocks and savings. It is in the interests of the general public to protect their assets.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: What have been the developments with regards to regulations and the role of the government since the crisis?</p><b></b><p>Jang: I credit the government with changing laws and regulations over the last two-and-a-half years. If we didn’t have a crisis, it would have taken another 20 years to bring those changes about. </p><p>But progress has [been slow]. We just changed the frame. Now we have to fill in the structure with details. How do we do it? </p><p>Let’s take an example: Cumulative voting, so that minority shareholders can elect a member of the board. We introduced it, but also gave companies the freedom to exclude it by changing their articles of incorporation. So naturally, every chaebol company excluded it. The cumulative voting system became totally ineffective. Now we are talking about making it mandatory. The Russian experience says that cumulative voting is working very well there. At least one member of the board represents the minority shareholders. It may be a very small example but it serves as a very critical and important feature of minority shareholder rights protection. I’m pushing very hard to have the class action suit as a part of our legal system. Without a class action suit, someone can manipulate a stock price and there’s not much you can do about it, unless tens of thousands of people file a suit at the same time, which is practically impossible. So even with stricter regulations, there are a lot of stock price manipulations.</p><b><i></i></b><p>Knowledge@Wharton: How should foreign investors perceive Korea’s long-term potential?</p><b></b><p>Jang: I believe Korea has a good industrial basis. It has a reasonably talented, hard working, well-disciplined labor force. That is why Korea has achieved such rapid economic growth in such a short period, despite the absence of natural resources … And now Korea is part of the OECD and the WTO, so for everything we export, we also must import.</p><p>Human capital is the real engine for economic growth. And I think we will enjoy this resource for quite awhile.</p><p>On average, Korean companies are severely undervalued. There are a lot of bargains. Even a company like Samsung Electronics, which is the most efficiently-run and the biggest company in Korea – probably one of the few Korean companies which international investors view as an international company rather than a local Korean company – has a current share value that’s less than half of the fair value in the international community. Investors don’t have confidence in corporate governance. But it’s not undervalued if you take into account those corporate governance risks. So if we get rid of these risks by improving transparencies and accountabilities [so they conform to] international standards, then with the same industrial base we can easily double our value.</p><p>I offer one simple example: Korea Telecom, which has a monopoly on the telephone business, including the wireless telephone business. It is a monopoly in a population of 40 million. Let’s compare it to Singapore Telecom, which has a similar monopoly in a population of just 4 million. Korea Telecom has a market ten times bigger than Singapore Telecom, and yet their market capitalization is smaller than Singapore Telecom. So, Korea Telecom is one-tenth of Singapore Telecom’s value. In other words, if we improve corporate governance with the same output, we can easily increase our value.</p><p>Korea provides a great, great investment opportunity for the international community. When Daewoo Motors failed, GM, Ford, and every major auto-maker in the world wanted it because it had good facilities and a good, well-trained labor force. This situation applies in other industries also. Koreans are hard working and well motivated, so we have the potential … The question is whether we can change our system to fit into the new open economy.</p>

						<p>Economic growth is the casualty of a widening gap between the rich and the poor among member countries of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/social/Focus-Inequality-and-Growth-2014.pdf">report</a> issued last month. The richest 10% of the population in OECD countries earn 9.5 times more than the poorest 10%. In the 1980s, that ratio was 7:1, and the income gap is at its highest level in about 30 years. The report suggests that the growing income inequality has, over the past two decades, cost the U.S. between 6 and 7 percentage points in economic growth, nine points in the U.K., and 10 points in New Zealand and Mexico.</p>
<p>“Income inequality is a source of concern not just from a social point of view, but also from an economic point of view,” said Stefano Scarpetta, director of employment, labor and social affairs at the OECD. He attributed the growing inequality to globalization and technological progress, and called for more access to quality education for people in lower-income households. He also saw a bigger role for private companies in training and retraining workers to bridge gaps in skills.</p>
<p>Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="https://fnce.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/930/">Joao F. Gomes</a> was not as convinced of the connection between income inequality and economic growth, and said that many other factors could be at play. He also noted that <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.wharton.upenn.edu%2Farticle%2Fhow-income-inequality-may-be-hurting-economic-growth%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknlg.net%2F1xaSujP&amp;source=tweetbutton&amp;text=%27The%20rich%20are%20getting%20richer%20in%20rich%20countries%2C%20but%20the%20rich%20countries%20are%20not%20getting%20richer.%27%20Via%20%40whartonknows%3A" class="fyc_printfriendly tweetthislink" target="_blank">“the rich are getting richer in rich countries, but the rich countries are not getting richer — the poor countries are.”  <i class="ss-icon ss-social" style="font-size:10pt">Twitter</i> </a>In any event, he underscored the need to focus on education, especially with targeted programs.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>Scarpetta and Gomes discussed the takeaways for policy makers from the OECD report on the Knowledge@Wharton show <a target="_blank" href="http://businessradio.wharton.upenn.edu/">on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111</a>. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)</p>
<blockquote><p>“[People from poor socio-economic backgrounds] contribute less to economic growth because they cannot fully invest in their potential and develop their talents.”<span class="attribution">–Stefano Scarpetta</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, an OECD survey of people who discontinued their education for a job found that in countries with high income inequality, people from poor socio-economic backgrounds have less access to education, particularly higher education. “They contribute less to economic growth because they cannot fully invest in their potential and develop their talents,” said Scarpetta.</p>

<p>Gomes said that inequality <em>within</em> countries has undoubtedly increased significantly in the last 20-25 years. However, “inequality <em>across</em> countries has decreased enormously,” he pointed out. “That is something to think about more carefully as we think of policies to reduce inequality.”</p>
<p>He also found it hard to conclude from the report that inequality leads to weaker economic growth. “It is a little hard to disentangle these things,” he said. “For example, [the report says] human capital doesn’t matter for growth; education does matter. Or that investment doesn’t matter for growth. [The] true drivers of inequality and growth are hard to identify. I am hesitant to jump from this to policies to deal with this issue.”</p>
<p>Scarpetta maintained that the OECD’s “results are fairly robust.” However, he agreed with Gomes on the difficulties in comparative analyses across countries to identify the effects of income inequality. “It is not the last word — far from that — but [Gomes] points to an important element for reflection. By no means should we build policies only on that. But it is opening up an avenue for further research.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“If we are going to liberalize trade, we need a majority of people to benefit from it.”<span class="attribution">–Joao F. Gomes</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Gomes was not convinced that difficulties in accessing education increase income inequality. “The question we have to ask with these kinds of studies is: Is this going to harm growth?” he said. “I am more concerned about increased globalization and the increased skills premium for talent. More and more, people need to share into this success story. If we are going to liberalize trade, we need a majority of people to benefit from it.”</p>
<p><strong>A Preference for Inequality?</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. seems to prefer income inequality, relative to Europe, according to Gomes. Scarpetta agreed with him. “There is an element of social preference — how much tolerance there is for the level of income inequality,” Scarpetta said. Tax and transfer systems to redistribute income explain the differences between countries in their tolerance to income inequality, he added. “Nordic countries have a significant way to compensate for an increase in market income inequality through distribution — much more than in the U.S. or in a number of other countries.”</p>
<p>Both Scarpetta and Gomes expressed concern over the study’s finding of “huge variations in the levels of competence” in the U.S. among working adults. “This is because of the education system, which creates a lot of people with high talent and competence, but also people with very low levels of competence,” said Scarpetta. For the latter group, “it is very difficult to find jobs, or find rewarding and productive jobs, as our economies become more competitive, precisely because they are operating in a global context,” he added.</p>
<p>Scarpetta found it “astonishing” that in the U.S., the top 1% of the population accounted for 20% of the total pre-tax income (in 2012) , up from 8% in the 1980s. However, raising tax rates will not fix that income inequality, he said, though he noted that other measures, like closing loopholes in the tax code and reducing exemptions, would help.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s about repurposing people, [and] training them at later stages in response to shocks that change the things they need to do to be successful 20 years from now.” <span class="attribution">–Joao F. Gomes</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Takeaways for Action</strong></p>
<p>According to Scarpetta, it is imperative that countries invest in early childhood education “when some of the important building blocks are made.” Increased access and improved quality of education for those from low socio-economic backgrounds are equally important, he said. “An even bigger challenge is to skill and re-skill those who are already in the labor markets, because their existing skills may no longer adapt to the way in which economies have evolved,” he added. “This has to be a partnership between public intervention and private sector companies.”</p>
<p>Gomes agreed with that agenda, but called for targeted policies instead of across-the-board investments in education. “It’s about repurposing people, [and] training them at later stages in response to shocks that change the things they need to do to be successful 20 years from now.”</p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/022108_refund.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Congress and the White House recently settled on an economic stimulus package with unusual speed, pushing the throttle to pull the economy out of a nosedive. Is this just election-year grandstanding, or does economic stimulus really work? And if it <em>can</em> work, what works best?</p><br>
<p>While some experts argue that priming the economy now is unnecessary, ill-timed or even counter-productive, those who support the concept applaud the design of the recently approved $168 billion package, centered on rebates of $600 to $1,200 for more than 130 million households. “They have moved remarkably quickly, so maybe this time it will, in fact, be well-timed,” says <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/souleles.html">Nicholas S. Souleles</a>, finance professor at Wharton. Souleles conducted a study titled, <a target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=807866&amp;download=yes">“Household Expenditure and the Income Tax Rebates of 2001,”</a> that found a 2001 stimulus package did indeed help the economy recover from recession.</p><br>
<p>That smaller plan included permanent tax cuts that encouraged consumers to increase their spending, while the current package has only temporary features, he says. But this shortcoming may be offset by today’s greater emphasis on getting money to low- and moderate-income people who are especially likely to spend it quickly. “If the new rebate is being more directed towards [financially] constrained households, that … difference would tend to increase the total spending,” he notes. More consumer spending will increase companies’ sales, reducing any need for workforce cuts and encouraging growth. At least, that’s the theory. </p><br>
<p>The stimulus should work, suggests Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeremysiegel.com/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a>. But that’s what worries him: He thinks the economy is likely to recover later in the year anyway, and that the stimulus package could combine with rising commodity prices to spur inflation. “I do think the economy is going to recover,” he says. “The Fed may have to start raising interest rates in the third quarter to offset the stimulus from this package… .This just makes the job of the central bank a little harder.”</p><br>
<p><strong>Housing Bubble vs. Tech Bubble</strong></p><br>
<p>Offering yet another view, Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~marstonr/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/marstonr/" target="_blank">Richard Marston</a> thinks today’s economic problems are quite different from those of 2001, and likely to be more severe and long-lasting — and resistant to remedies. The key feature of today’s downturn is the collapsed housing bubble, which has a broader effect than the burst tech-stock bubble of 2001, he says.</p><br>
<p>While the rebates will lead to more spending, Marston notes, the lack of a long-term tax cut will make the stimulus package less effective than the one in 2001. At the same time, the Fed’s interest-rate cuts will not work as well because today’s credit problems are caused by lenders’ fear of risk rather than a shortage of money to lend. Reducing rates will not necessarily reduce that fear. “I think the banking part of this is more problematical this time than it was in 2001 because we’re in the middle of a fixed-income crisis — because people just don’t trust each other,” he says, adding: “It’s very scary, very scary…. I don’t see a quick recovery.”</p><br>
<p>It is not yet clear that the U.S. economy fits the technical definition of a recession — generally seen as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, plus other criteria — but there’s no doubt it is in trouble. The economy grew just 2.2% in 2007, the lowest level since 1.6% in 2002. In the fourth quarter, it grew at an annual rate of 0.6%, down from 4.9% the quarter before. </p><br>
<p>Bad economic news has continued this year: On February 15, the government reported that import prices had soared in January at the highest rate since 1983, and that manufacturing was declining. The most recent Reuters/University of Michigan survey showed consumer confidence at its lowest since early 1992.</p><br>
<p>Siegel says a recession appears more likely than it did a few months ago, but that a recession, if it occurs, is not likely to be deep or prolonged because the employment and consumer spending pullbacks have not been severe. “The odds are definitely going up,” he says of recession prospects. “But so what? If we get plus-point-one percent [GDP growth] it’s <em>not</em> a recession; if we get minus point-one percent, it <em>is</em> a recession. Nobody can tell the difference.”</p><br>
<p>Others are less optimistic. “I think the economy’s contracting,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist and co-founder of Moody’s Economy.com. “It shrank in December. It shrank in January…. It’s likely contracting again for February. We still have another three or six months of decline to go. That is recession.”</p><br>
<p>Zandi points to falling employment figures and pullbacks in retail and vehicle sales. In addition, his weekly survey of businesses finds executives newly focused on the need to cut payrolls and equipment investment.</p><br>
<p>But several factors could keep the recession mild, according to Zandi. “Corporate balance sheets, outside housing-related businesses, are in good shape,” he says. Hence, companies “can weather a very serious financial storm like the one we are experiencing.” And the global economy remains strong. “I think, particularly, emerging economies, which account for half of global GDP, will hold up very well.” </p><br>
<p>Finally, U.S. policy makers are handling the downturn well, Zandi adds, citing the Federal Reserve’s recent rate cuts and Fed chairman Benjamin Bernanke’s signals that more cuts could come quickly. “The fiscal stimulus is significant and unprecedented in the sense that it was put together so quickly.” The rebates are “targeted to the right people, who are more likely to spend them quickly. I suspect most people who get this money are going to spend it on groceries, daily living expenses, electric bills…. I think it will be enough to get the economy growing, along with low interest rates.”</p><br>
<p><strong>2001 vs. 2008</strong></p><br>
<p>The best analogy to the current package was the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, a response to the recession that began that March. About two-thirds of U.S. households received tax rebates of $300 to $600 as an advance on the income-tax cuts that also were part of that package.</p><br>
<p>Souleles, along with David S. Johnson of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Princeton economist Jonathan A. Parker, added questions to the Bureau’s regular Consumer Expenditure Survey to find out how people used the rebates</p><br>
<p>For logistical reasons, the government spread the $38 billion in rebate checks over 10 weeks from late July to late September. Because each week’s recipients were selected at random, the survey, taken as a whole, automatically negated the effects of other temporary influences on spending, such as changes in the stock market or car makers’ cheap-financing deals.</p><br>
<p>The study found that the average household spent 20% to 40% of its rebate on non-durable goods during the three-month period the money was received. After six months, about two-thirds of the rebate had been spent.</p><br>
<p>The rebates increased consumer spending on non-durable items by about 2.9% in the third quarter of 2001 and 2.1% in the fourth quarter, a significant boost that coincided with the economy’s recovery, the authors said. “Our findings imply that the rebates provided a substantial stimulus to the national economy, helping to end the recession of 2001.” </p><br>
<p>Souleles and his colleagues also found that in the three months during which the rebates were received, low-income households spent 63% more of the money on non-durable goods than high-income households did, buying things like food, clothing and health-related items. “In sum, we find that households with low income or low liquid wealth consumed more of their rebates than typical [households did]…” the authors wrote.</p><br>
<p>The 2008 rebate should stimulate the economy much as the earlier one did, Souleles says, though its features are somewhat different. The current plan is richer: It is expected to cost $152 billion in 2008 and $16 billion in 2009, compared to $38 billion in 2001. In the new plan, rebates will average $600 for individuals and $1,200 for couples filing joint returns, plus $300 for a dependent child. That’s twice the 2001 level.</p><br>
<p>In the earlier package, rebates were paid to all taxpayers regardless of income. The current one has phase-outs to provide the bulk of the money to households of low and moderate income. The payout will be reduced by 5% for every $1,000 an individual makes in excess of $75,000, or that a couple makes above $150,000.</p><br>
<p>Even people with little or no tax liability can qualify for a minimum of $300 per individual or $600 per couple in the current program, so long as they file a tax return reflecting at least $3,000 in income. Taxpayers will qualify based on their 2007 tax returns, due by April 15, and checks will be mailed beginning in May. Another chief difference: The 2001 program was part of a 10-year reduction in income-tax rates for all taxpayers, while the 2008 payment is one-time-only.</p><br>
<p>People were especially likely to spend their 2001 rebates because they knew further tax savings would follow, Souleles says. While the current program does not have that spending incentive, this may be offset by its greater emphasis on people of low and moderate incomes. “You can judge these policies by their goal, and it’s very much a goal of short-term stimulus,” Souleles says. “It would follow that you would want to disproportionately target these things to the households that are likely to spend them… the constrained households.”</p><br>
<p>Zandi agrees. “I think it’s a good tax rebate as far as rebates go…,” he says. “It is targeted to the right people, who are more likely to spend it quickly…. I think it will be enough to get the economy growing, along with low interest rates.”</p><br>
<p><strong>The Check Is in the Mail</strong></p><br>
<p>But the stimulus package may not have the same effect everywhere, notes Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/roussanov.html"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/nroussan/" target="_blank">Nikolai Roussanov</a>. Two households with the same income may experience an economic downturn very differently depending on where they live, he says. The family in a high-cost region like California will feel the downturn more severely and respond by spending the rebate on necessities like food. The family in a low-cost region such as the South may not be hurting as badly, and will be more inclined to spend the rebate on luxuries, or to save it. Therefore, says Roussanov, it is very hard to predict how well the stimulus package will work. “The same dollar of income buys different consumption bundles for people in different parts of the country.” </p><br>
<p>A boost in consumer spending will not come for some time. Checks will start flowing in May, but it could be summer or fall before consumers have their rebates and decide what to do with them.</p><br>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://irm.wharton.upenn.edu/smetters.htm"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/smetters/" target="_blank">Kent Smetters</a>, Wharton professor of insurance and risk management, such delays make fiscal stimulus a clumsier way to deal with short-term economic problems than monetary policy — Fed rate cuts. “I tend to lean more toward using monetary policy for short-term things, and using fiscal policy to get the long-term things right,” he says, adding, “We typically think monetary policy is a little quicker…. By the time these [rebate] checks come out, who knows where the economy will be?” </p><br>
<p>A January 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office, <em>Options for Responding to Short-term Economic Weakness,</em> notes that timing is indeed critical. A “recognition lag” caused by the masking effects of high inflation led the government to adopt a stimulus plan well after the 1974 recession had begun, the report says. The tax rebates did not take effect until March 1975, making the stimulus, at best, an unnecessary expense and, at worst, a counter-productive spur to inflation.</p><br>
<p>But the CBO found that economic weakness was spotted much more quickly during the two most recent recessions, in 1990 and 2001, when inflation was not so high — a condition similar to today’s. “The experience of the past two recessions suggests that recognition lags need not always impede effective stimulus,” the CBO states.</p><br>
<p>Clearly, each economic downturn has unique characteristics, making it impossible to predict for certain how well the government’s response will work. But although economists have varying opinions about the wisdom of the latest stimulus package, they tend to agree on one thing: No economic boom is in the near-term forecast. </p><br>
<p>“I do worry that the recovery in late ’08 and ’09 could be very disappointing,” Zandi says. “That will depend on what happens in the financial system. If conditions don’t improve soon, then I think the economy’s going to struggle. It’s going to grow — it won’t be a recession. But it’s going to feel uncomfortable.”</p>

<p><span><em>The International Monetary Fund has watched the Arab Spring play out, and now seeks a role for those Arab countries in transition. In late May, the IMF called on developed countries, including the G-8, to provide assistance to the Arab world, estimating the external financing needs of oil-importing countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region would be more than US$160 billion over the next three years.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Like many international entities, the IMF has cautiously provided advice, seeing the unrest as an opportunity to introduce reform to a region that has largely stagnated under authoritarian rule. It is backing its words up with generous funds — recently offering billions in aid packages for Tunisia and Egypt, and potentially for Yemen.</em></span></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><span><em>Masood Ahmed is director of the International Monetary Fund’s Middle East and Central Asia Department. In discussion with Arabic Knowledge@Wharton, Ahmed speaks about the role economic liberalization has played in the rise of the Arab Spring, and the economic and governance challenges facing countries that have deposed regimes. There is also the balance between wanting to encourage growth, and needing to provide subsidies and civil jobs, he says. Ahmed argues a country should not just focus on growth, but also ensure economic benefits reach a wider portion of its population.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>An edited transcript of the conversation follows.</em></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>After regime change, how can a government strike a balance of revoking or cancelling illegal deals, while and at the same time not scare away foreign investors who had signed contracts under the previous regimes?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Masood Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>The events in the region are a timely reminder of the importance of transparency and good governance. Uncertainty and uneven application of regulatory policies that benefit a minority of privileged or connected individuals are major constraints to private sector activity. Business-friendly policy reforms-including the revocation or cancellation of illegal deals-would help boost confidence and attract foreign investment. Building a strong institutional framework to promote competition is important in this respect, including for example, an independent auditing mechanism for public finances, procurement rules, and transparency of fiscal accounts.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton: </span></strong><span>Governments are raising subsidies and increasing handouts in countries, including several Gulf States. Do you foresee these policies will be in place for an extended period of time, halting reforms that were aimed at lowering dependence on Gulf governments and diversifying the economy away from oil?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>The key subsidy in GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries is for domestic petroleum prices, which are set at a low level and adjusted rarely-in some countries, prices have not been adjusted since the 1980s. In addition, most countries in the Middle East have announced new measures that attempt to dampen pressures from higher food prices, provide support to the unemployed, and alleviate housing constraints. The cost of these measures ranges between 0.3% of GDP (for Algeria) and about 22% of GDP (for Saudi Arabia, spread over a number of years).</span></p>
<p><span>While most of the oil-exporting countries in the region can easily afford this extra expenditure, some of the measures are not well-targeted for the neediest, can be difficult to reverse, and will impact fiscal outcomes over the medium-term. Therefore, as part of a plan to strengthen public finances over the medium term, it will be important to develop a more cost-effective system of social protection, focused on assisting low-income households, possibly including conditional cash transfers. While setting up such transfers will take time in many countries, in the near term one way of targeting poorer households could be to subsidize those products and services that are consumed mainly by the poor, rather than providing universal price subsidies that benefit the entire population. Reforming universal fuel price subsidies would also help contain rapidly rising domestic energy consumption.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Do you foresee greater government spending aimed at fostering economic growth limiting private sector growth and crowding it?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>Higher government spending is occurring in the context of increased oil revenues, so GCC countries are likely to see higher-than-expected fiscal surpluses, despite the higher spending. Higher fiscal surpluses translate into less need for domestic financing for government and high levels of liquidity in banking systems. The absence of an increase in credit growth over the past two years is explained by the weak demand in the wake of the global crisis as well as banks’ reluctance to lend in an uncertain environment. To stimulate private sector productive activity and increase demand for credit, government spending should focus on investment rather than current spending, and enabling a business-friendly environment.</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>In the wake of the Arab Srping, Gulf governments are entrenching temporary public sector employees and raising overall public sector wages. How will these new policies help lower the unemployment rate and improve economic conditions, if they create little incentive for citizens to seek private sector jobs, while a greater public sector exacerbates bureaucracy?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>Governments throughout the Middle East are seeking ways to tackle unemployment. The most direct policy option available, when there is room in the budget, is to expand public sector employment, and several GCC countries have announced plans to do this. Higher public-sector employment will only be part of the solution and needs to be accompanied by private-sector growth. Reducing unemployment on a permanent basis will require a combination of higher economic growth and reforms to improve the responsiveness of the labor market. These could be achieved by implementing reforms aimed at creating a business climate more conducive to investment and competition, together with policies to improve labor market flexibility and reduce skills mismatches.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How can the International Monetary Fund (IMF) encourage countries experiencing unrest to continue to pursue economic liberalization? Will there be opportunity to provide loans beyond the US$35 billion proposed to oil-importers?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>When we recommend policies that help liberalize economic activity, we do so for a number of reasons: privatization, for example, can help fix loss-making and inefficient enterprises, thereby freeing public resources that can be redirected toward more productive spending, including, for example, on health and education, or on public investment. Privatization can also reenergize the economy by fostering competition, thereby creating jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>When we recommend such reforms, we also advise to set them in a framework that ensures good governance and provide appropriate safeguards to reap the full benefits of such programs. For instance, it is important that close attention is paid to the way privatization is carried out. For example, the right institutions, such as well-functioning regulators, need to be in place, and the privatization process needs to be designed in a fair and open way to ensure that the gains go to the government and the broader population rather than to a few insiders.</span></p>
<p><span>Trade liberalization plays a key role in supporting domestic production by providing the best inputs, and consumers are allowed more choice and better value. Liberalization also contributes to higher income, exports, and job creation. Outdated or weak regulations and institutions that encourage corruption and monopolies can undermine the benefits of trade liberalization. That is why it is important to modernize these regulations and strengthen institutions to ensure a level-playing field that allows average-income households to benefit from trade liberalization and other reforms. It is also important to complement trade liberalization with other reforms aimed at enhancing competitiveness.</span></p>
<p><span>As our managing director has said, the IMF could make around US$35 billion available to the region–by applying the average size of recent IMF-supported programs to the MENA oil importers–a rather large amount of resources. Of course, not all countries will request programs, and the size of programs will vary. But with or without direct financing, the IMF will be engaging with countries and offering advice on how to navigate these difficult times. Plus, we will continue to give countries technical assistance in our areas of expertise, including for example on fiscal and central bank issues.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>In countries such as Egypt, people often blame IMF-inspired policies for their social and economic grievances. How palatable will IMF assistance be in these countries, especially if financial assistance is provided?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>Over time, we have found that the programs that are the most successful are the ones that are homegrown and owned not just by the authorities, but by the people. This means, among other things, creating an environment that boosts investment, jobs creation, and policies to protect the poor. Any comprehensive program would also include measures that help ensure macroeconomic stability, which is important for social stability.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of Egypt, the first priority is for the authorities to define the economic policy framework that best suits the country in consultation with the various factions of the Egyptian society. The IMF will also engage with representatives of civil society and other segments of the population to get their feedback and understand what policies are broadly owned by the population.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, there are a number of benefits associated with a request for assistance from the IMF. First, the IMF can provide temporary financing to help the country transition to better times. Second, this solution is typically less costly than borrowing from the private sector, leaving room for other policy priorities. Third, when there is agreement on economic policies between the IMF and a member country government, it sends a signal of confidence to the markets as well as to other multilateral and bilateral lenders that a country’s economic policies are on the right track. This provides reassurance to investors and the official community, helping countries find additional financing from other sources.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Will the raising of subsidies and wages only buy governments time, yet exacerbate the economic problems for countries adopting these measures?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>Many governments in the region have responded to surging food and fuel prices by higher fiscal spending to provide relief to the population. Given the urgency, this policy response has relied on readily available instruments, including subsidies and wages. Universal price subsides have the disadvantage of not being targeted to those segments of the population most in need of government assistance, as such, they are costly. Therefore, over the medium-term, governments should consider replacing existing universal price subsidies with targeted subsidies, possibly in the context of moving toward a comprehensive and well-targeted social safety net.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How can the international community, besides the World Bank and the IMF, help countries that need to appease popular demands and nurture their economies at the same time?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>Countries in the region will find their own path for change and leadership. The way forward should come from the countries themselves. But it will be equally important for the international community to ease their short-term financial burden and support the longer-term political, social, and economic transformation, given the shared interest in a prosperous and stable region. Technical and financial assistance and further opening of markets will be key elements of such support. Partnership with the region, both to support the emergence of a transformation agenda and in providing financial assistance, could ensure strong domestic ownership.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Many countries in the region are asking for debt relief and aid, but to foster growth they need greater access to international markets. How can countries, such as the ones in North Africa, increase trade to regions such as Europe when there are trade barriers and policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy that impede the free flow of goods?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>With the EU as a main trading partner, North African countries would benefit largely from a further opening up of the European markets. In 1995, the Barcelona Conference paved the way for the creation of a free-trade zone between the EU and its Mediterranean partners. Hence, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Algeria signed bilateral free-trade agreements (FTA) with the EU in 1995, 1996, 2001, and 2002, respectively. These agreements constitute the basis for complete liberalization of trade and set out a framework for the relationship in other areas, such as foreign direct investment flows. Nevertheless, the process of integration has remained uneven since the signature of the agreements.</span></p>
<p><span>More recently, the EU granted Morocco preferential "advanced status" in 2008, and discussions are planned to grant Tunisia the same status in the near future. Providing such status would help countries in the region enhance the contribution of trade to growth. Furthermore, accelerating the completion of trade liberalization for agricultural products and services would support the development of those sectors, which employ a large share of the labor force.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>In countries where economic growth didn’t trickle down to the impoverished, how can future governments ensure that their policies achieve a trickle-down effect?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>A key lesson from recent events in the region is that economic growth in itself is not enough. Attention needs to focus not only at achieving high and sustainable growth, but also on the question of who benefits from it. As is clear from events in the region, inequality and uneven access to economic opportunity stretch the social fabric and ultimately lead to social and, subsequently, economic instability.</span></p>
<p><span>For growth to help raise living standards, it must also create enough jobs for a growing labor force — and to that end, should be led by the private sector. In addition, growth needs to be more inclusive, which means that governments need to ensure that all segments of the population have access to economic opportunities through fair, transparent, and competitive processes. What is needed is an environment where people, especially young people, have opportunities to acquire a good education, to compete for high-quality jobs, to become entrepreneurs and to have access to credit. Moreover, growth should be accompanied by social policies to protect the most vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>With a greater reliance on oil income due to low non-oil sector growth, how big is the danger of oil exporters falling hostage to oil price volatility?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ahmed:</span></strong> <span>The performance of the non-oil sector is not uniformly low across the region’s oil-exporting countries. As noted in our April 2011 Regional Economic Outlook, we project non-oil growth for these countries at 3.5% in 2011 — roughly the same as in 2010 (excluding Libya, of course, where conditions at present are very uncertain). While non-oil activity in some countries will contract as a result of unrest (in Bahrain, for example) or transitional effects of a widespread subsidy reform (Iran), in others, the non-oil sector may benefit from stepped-up government spending (in Saudi Arabia, for example).</span></p>
<p><span>These countries are currently benefiting from higher oil prices, which are allowing for greater expenditure but, in some cases, expanded government spending programs have raised the break-even prices for fiscal and external current account balances (the price at which the government would run an overall fiscal/current account balance, holding everything else constant). It is crucial that these spending programs do not lead to a permanent ratcheting-up of expenditures that rely on oil revenues for financing. In particular, governments should aim to diversify their revenue base precisely to reduce its vulnerability to oil price fluctuations. To that end, achieving greater economic diversification remains a key challenge.</span></p>

						<p>Portugal is celebrating an economic recovery after a prolonged recession that began in 2003 and worsened after the 2008 Great Recession. The nation’s GDP grew 2.7% in 2017 — the highest in many years — and while that is projected to taper off some this year, growth should still hit 2.2%.</p>
<p>There are a least two views about what has led to the recovery. One suggests that Portugal’s decision to end the harshest IMF/EU austerity measures in 2015, and boost spending and investment led the charge. Another is that Portugal simply benefited passively, along with others, from a strong recovery in Europe overall.</p>
<p>As a <em>New York Times</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/business/portugal-economy-austerity.html">report</a> observed, with various officials quoted to support the view, “At a time of mounting uncertainty in Europe, Portugal has defied critics who have insisted on austerity as the answer to the Continent’s economic and financial crisis.”</p><div class="active friend-module-target">
    <aside class="friend-module">

<p>The austerity measures demanded of Portugal via the International Monetary Fund and the European Union were widely viewed as tough, and entailed severe spending cuts, cutbacks of wages, pensions and social security. In return for accepting the cutbacks, the IMF/EU agreed in 2011 to bail out Portugal with $90 billion to manage its fiscal deficit, capitalize weak banks and reduce nonperforming loans, improve employment, and gain greater access to world financial markets.</p>
<p>The <em>Times’s</em> story goes on to note that in 2015 Portugal took a “daring stand” when it “cast aside the harshest austerity measures its European creditors had imposed, igniting a virtuous cycle that put its economy back on a path to growth.”</p>
<p>The country reversed the cuts noted above and instead “offered incentives to businesses.” That reversal and a willingness to boost spending “had a powerful effect. Creditors railed against the move, but the gloom that had gripped the nation through years of belt-tightening began to lift. Business confidence rebounded. Production and exports began to take off,” notes the <em>Times’s </em>story.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When the tide comes in, all the boats go up and that’s what happened to the Portuguese economy.”<span class="attribution">–Joao Borges de Assuncao</span></p></blockquote>
<p>But Wharton finance professor <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/gomesj/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/gomesj/" target="_blank">Joao Gomes</a>, a native of Lisbon, said that Portugal’s economic recovery is better understood in the context of the broader recovery across Europe, which he rated as “excellent.” Portugal has benefited from Europe’s economic recovery in a few ways: tourism, exports and increased domestic investment. These have helped reduce the unemployment rate from its peak of 17.5% in the first quarter of 2013 to 7.9% in the first quarter of 2018.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/person/joao-borges-de-assuncao?parent-page=247">Joao Borges de Assuncao</a>, a professor at the Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics in Lisbon, said Portugal’s ongoing economic recovery has made it “a poster child for what could be done differently in the context of the European recovery.” His view is that the country’s rebound began when some of the austerity measures were ended, allowing it to bounce back from the 2008 Great Recession and three years of negative GDP growth and high unemployment. De Assuncao was formerly economic advisor to the Portuguese President in 2006-2016 and to the Portuguese Prime Minister from 2002 to 2004.</p>
<p>Portugal’s recovery was helped by “a benign external environment,” which made possible “a job-rich and broad-based growth,” according to the view of the IMF in its latest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imf.org/en/publications/cr/issues/2018/02/22/portugal-sixth-post-program-monitoring-discussions-press-release-staff-report-45650">report</a> in February, echoing the view of Gomes. Suggesting the nation is not out of the woods entirely, the report also noted that it still faces vulnerabilities with potentially higher interest rates, high public debt to GDP ratios, bad loans on bank balance sheets and the possibility of “cyclical downturns” in its trading with its partners. The IMF called for “durable expenditure reforms,” and stronger bank balance sheets to make it possible for Portugal to provide new credit for investment.</p>
<p>De Assuncao and Gomes discussed Portugal’s economic growth and the challenges on the <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/category/business-radio/" target="_blank">Knowledge@Wharton radio show on SiriusXM</a><em>.</em> (Listen to the full podcast at the top of this page.)</p>

<p>Portugal had much to gain from the European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe that European Commission President <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Juncker">Jean-Claude Juncker</a> unveiled in November 2014. “Europe committed to this plan to effectively stimulate or subsidize investment throughout various parts of the EU, mostly in the South but not exclusively, by just essentially providing matching funds to a number of programs that qualified under certain criteria,” said Gomes. One feature helping Portugal is financial aid for small businesses enterprises. That added some 2 billion euros to the economy, or about 5% of total investment.</p>
<p>Gomes also pointed out that the biggest boost Portugal received from Europe’s recovery came via exports, with the continent taking up 75% of the country’s exports of goods and services. De Assuncao agreed: “The big change is essentially exports, including services,” linked to the overall improvement in Europe’s economy, particularly over the last two years. “When the tide comes in, all the boats go up and that’s what happened to the Portuguese economy.”</p>
<p><strong>A Tempered View</strong></p>
<p>Gomes also brought a sobering note to the excitement over Portugal’s economic recovery. “You can call it a recovery, but we’re still far below where we were just before the crisis. Look at every single number. Taxes relative to GDP are 44% — they haven’t budged one bit. The government collects the same amount of revenue that it did; it spends the same amount that it did, except for some one-offs in aid to the financial sector. The deficit is basically the same. Public investment is basically the same.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s just not a lot of room to go forward, if we don’t increase productivity.”<span class="attribution">–Joao Gomes</span></p></blockquote>
<p>“The boom has been mostly because of housing to some extent, hospitality and some side benefits of the Juncker plan for Europe, which has really subsidized investment in Portugal in the last couple of years.” Still, investment remains 25% below 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity Is Key</strong></p>
<p>Gomes said productivity growth is critical if Portugal is to continue its economic rally. “The real cloud in the story over the last 20 years or so is that [Portugal is] just not more productive. There’s just not a lot of room to go forward, if we don’t increase productivity.” With higher employment, it is important to have higher productivity as well to improve wage rates and living standards, he explained.</p>
<p>De Assuncao noted that Portugal has seen increased investment, most of that has come from the private sector. But that, too, has left something to be desired. “It should have been much, much higher,” he said. “Investment went down as much as 40% from its peak, or 44% cumulatively from 2002, and we have only recovered 25% of that. We need a few quarters of growth of around 10% to catch up and bring back the levels that the Portuguese economy requires.”</p>
<p>And more investment is essential to achieve productivity gains, de Assuncao added. “Last year, the growth in employment was much larger than the growth of GDP, with the consequence that we had negative productivity gains. And for us to get productivity gains we need private investment – most public investment is not productivity enhancing.”</p>
<p>One reason for that skewed impact of investments on productivity is that the Portuguese economy is not sufficiently broad-based. “We need a lot more diversification in our in our economic base,” de Assuncao noted. But for now, the recovery has boosted economic sentiment, which in itself could provide further impetus. “It affects the outlook of people and all the surveys indicate that the public mood is a lot better, so there is a lot more confidence and that also helps the recovery,” said de Assuncao.</p>
<p><strong>The Tourism Opportunity </strong></p>
<p>Gomes saw tourism as “the only obvious place” for fresh economic growth, and said that could benefit from growth in Europe, although if <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/u-k-options-brexit-negotiations/" target="_blank">Britain’s planned exit</a> from the European Union proceeds, it could dampen that optimism some. Tourism is important also from a productivity standpoint because Portugal has an aging population, made worse by outward migration of its youth in recent years, said Gomes.</p>
<p>De Assuncao elaborated, agreeing that tourism is the most obvious source of economic growth — in the short term. “The problem is that tourism is small in Portugal and it will never be very large.” Thus, tourism cannot provide the engine for economic growth Portugal needs. He added that it would be hard to extract productivity gains in tourism because it is labor-intensive and most of its capital investments are linked to real estate.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, de Assuncao reiterated his call to diversify the economy. But doing so requires public policy steps and the tendency is for the government in charge to select favorites, and thus make mistakes, he said. Portugal’s “best bet”: Increase eurozone participation. “The more we participate across all projects with other European countries that share the same regulatory environment, the same currency, and the same market rules, we can spread to many other industries.”</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Among the main challenges Portugal faces is its “very fragile banking sector,” saddled by non-performing loans given to “friends of the government,” said de Assuncao. Many of those loans are linked to real estate and higher real estate prices will make it easier to regularize them. De Assuncao echoed the IMF view in noting that the economy is “extremely vulnerable” with its debt-to-GDP ratio of 126%. “If interest rates go up – and they will they will pretty soon – it will be a huge problem because we would lose quite a bit of interest income to the outside world.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s great to see people doing so much better, so much happier, and so much more confident of the future.”<span class="attribution">–Joao Gomes</span></p></blockquote>
<p>“Portugal is maxed out on [its] credit cards,” said Gomes, adding that higher interest rates could spell doom. In that scenario, “the focus has to be relentlessly on growth.”</p>
<p>Among Portugal’s remaining woes is that the global financial crisis led to many among its millennial generation to migrate to other parts of Europe, Africa, Brazil and the U.S., Gomes noted. “They are some of the most talented, most highly educated individuals — the ones who have the option to move somewhere else. It’s a deficit of talent that we will not recover from in a generation. I think we’re not going to attract them back.”</p>
<p>Like others, Portugal also faces its share of global risks, such as the fallout from <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/trumps-tariffs-will-impact-average-consumer/" target="_blank">the U.S. trade war with China</a>, said de Assuncao. “The countries that are weaker, like Portugal and Italy, will be extremely vulnerable to those developments. So we need we need to prepare for that.”</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the Party</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Portugal should take a pause and “stop complaining” de Assuncao suggested. “We are enjoying this boom. It has been unusual and so people are happy. Maybe right now the best thing to do is to enjoy the party. At the same time, do not destroy the gains — do not allow the deficit to get out of line. We need a very steady hand by the government.”</p>
<p>He also cautioned the government against giving handouts in the form of bonuses to civil servants and tax discounts to restaurant owners, as it has done in the past. Added Gomes: “It’s great to see people doing so much better, so much happier, and so much more confident of the future.”</p>
<p>“We are still in many ways an example for other countries that hardship can be overcome,” said de Assuncao. “In many ways, we were able to overcome that with limited internal strife, especially compared to other European countries which are still in a very dire situation.”</p>

						<p>Japan and South Korea have some of the highest life expectancies in the world — 83.3 years and 81.5 years respectively. However, they also have two of the highest suicide rates, especially among males. In 2013, male suicide rates were 41.7 and 26.9 per 100,000 in South Korea and Japan respectively — the first- and third-highest rates among high-income Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Further, while suicide rates are declining in many countries, they are on the rise in Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>The main reasons for these high suicide rates include adverse economic conditions, unemployment, changing family structures, depression, inadequate access and resistance to mental health care, and substance abuse, according to “The Cost of High Suicide Rates in Japan and South Korea: Reduced Life Expectancies,” a research paper by Wharton student Elliot Oblander; Sojung Carol Park, associate professor of finance at Seoul National University in South Korea; and <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/lemaire-2/" target="_blank">Jean Lemaire</a>, Wharton professor of statistics and actuarial science. “Clearly, this is a major public health epidemic, which has a high impact on quality of life,” they write.</p>
<p>While quality of life is an abstract concept and the cost of any public health epidemic is difficult to measure, the paper suggests that life expectancy and impact on life expectancy can serve as proxies. “The life expectancy at birth is a widely accepted measure of quality of life in a society, summarizing in a single number all the natural and man-made damages that can affect an individual, ranging from poor health care systems and civil war to unhealthy nutrition and sexual behavior.”</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>The authors use actuarial multiple decrement techniques to measure the severity of Japan and South Korea’s suicide epidemics by calculating their impact on life expectancy at various ages. This, in turn, offers insights on how suicides affect quality of life for different age groups. The research shows “how much longer the already commendably long life expectancies of both countries would be without suicides.”</p>
<p>The paper found that suicides shortened the life expectancy at birth in Japan by 1.12% and 0.83% in South Korea. That translates to shortening the life of the average Japanese by 339.3 days and 246.6 for South Koreans. Broken down by gender, the study shows that men suffered more. Japanese men on average would lose 435.7 days and women 247.7 days while South Korean men lose 305.2 days and women 169.4 days.</p>
<p>There are differences among age groups as well. In Japan, suicide rates rise rapidly between ages 15 to 20 and stay roughly constant after that. In South Korea, on the other hand, suicide rates rise slowly but consistently from ages 15 to 65, and increase quickly after 65. This is primarily due to a rapidly changing social structure — multiple generations living together under one roof gave way to smaller families where the youth move away for jobs and school — and the erosion of the Confucian concept of “hyo,” or blind filial piety and respect to parents. These factors result in the weakening of family support.</p>
<p>Since Japan sees a higher suicide rate in younger age groups, there is a consequent larger impact on the quality of life at birth because the deceased individuals lose more years of potential life. In South Korea, the impact on life expectancy at birth is smaller due to suicides being concentrated around older populations. Impact peaks in Japan at 1.38% for ages 20 to 24, and then steadily declines. The impact in South Korea peaks for the 25 to 29 group at 1.06%, but stays fairly flat across all age groups, with a 0.80% impact on the 60-plus group.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>High Economic Cost to Society</strong></p>
<p>“Suicides at a young age have a major impact on the economy. Families and governments spend vast amounts on the education of children and young adults but do not reap the rewards of that investment since the young adults who commit suicide [do not have many] productive years. This deteriorates the dependency ratio (active population divided by non-active folks like seniors and young people), as active people bear the burden of caring for children, teenagers and seniors,” says Lemaire.</p>
<p>Pointing out that in all advanced countries the dependency ratio is deteriorating fast, and more so in Asian countries, Lemaire observes: “A life cut short by suicide further increases the dependency ratio, increases population aging, and modifies the age pyramid. Also, that person may have to be replaced by an immigrant, a delicate subject in South Korea and Japan.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Suicides at a young age have a major impact on the economy.”  <span class="attribution">–Jean Lemaire</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Frequent deaths from suicide take a huge emotional toll on communities, adds Oblander. “Apart from the life that is cut short, the family and friends of the victim experience great grief. Economic productivity is also harmed from an emotional level, since suicide at a company affects company culture and morale. The phenomenon of ‘karōshi’ (death from overwork) in Japan is frequently <a target="_blank" href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/29/national/social-issues/dentsu-suicide-kick-starts-efforts-alter-nations-ingrained-karoshi-habits/#.WIgZGrYrK_I">reported in the news</a>. At a company where employee suicide is a common occurrence, this is sure to adversely affect other employees.” Also, when an employee dies, potential years of productive work are lost, and filling the vacated position incurs search costs.</p>
<p>The economic impact due to suicides depends both on the age distribution of the suicides and the demographics of the labor force of the country in question, says Oblander. “For instance, Japan is already experiencing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-05/japan-s-labor-shortage-is-worst-in-the-least-productive-industries">labor shortage</a> due to its aging population. Therefore, the loss of young lives has a huge impact on economic outcomes. In South Korea, on the other hand, suicide is more concentrated in older populations, and as noted in our paper, the retirement age is very early, so relatively few suicides occur among active labor force participants. As a result, economic impact is smaller in South Korea.”</p>
<p>Lemaire adds another perspective. “South Korea and Japan are among the countries with the lowest fertility rate. A fertility rate of 2.1 per woman is ideal, as it maintains a stable population and does not disturb the age distribution. Among 224 countries mentioned in the CIA’s World Factbook, Japan ranks 210 with a fertility rate of 1.41 and Korea 220 with a fertility rate of 1.25. It is hard to overestimate the dramatic long-term influence of such low rates in terms of population aging and disturbances of the workforce. I would therefore conclude that suicides have a larger societal impact in Japan and South Korea, as suicides amplify the gigantic effects of the low fertility rate.”</p>
<p><strong>Preventive Measures</strong></p>
<p>Increased accessibility to good mental health care, along with long-term cultural changes — in particular, stigma around mental health and unreasonable societal expectations of overwork — can help in reducing suicide rates in these countries, says Oblander. Better support for elderly citizens like enabling participation in the labor force and other forms of social engagement to counter the adverse impacts of early mandatory retirement and possible social isolation can also be effective measures, he adds.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Economic productivity is also harmed from an emotional level, since suicide at a company affects company culture and morale.” <span class="attribution">–Elliot Oblander</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Lemaire notes that less lethal prescription drugs (sleeping pills and anti-depressants), safer cooking gas and limiting access to high places have been effective preventive measures. “I believe that regulations have pretty much achieved all they potentially could. What remains to be improved is mental health. There is strong evidence to show that once suicidal persons have been identified, mental treatment can be very effective — there are few second attempts at suicide. The key is to improve early detection of depression, obviously not an easy task.”</p>
<p>Lemaire suggests that educators and medical professionals can play an important role in early identification of individuals with suicidal tendencies while governments can accelerate some aspects of cultural changes. He notes that when studying suicide rates across the world, broad groups of countries emerge. Suicide rates are low in Muslim, Hindu and Latin American countries, high in Eastern Europe and Asia, and in the middle in the U.S. and Western Europe. “Cultural changes in Japan and South Korea are occurring very fast. Some are destabilizing (breakdown of traditional family values, sense of powerlessness due to rapid globalization), while others are a step in the right direction. Government can help mitigate the negative effects of globalization while encouraging the positive changes.”</p>
<p>To be sure, implementing reforms come with their own inherent challenges. “Much of this comes down to determining what policies will be effective and whether such policies are politically feasible. More politically favorable initiatives may be more watered-down,” says Oblander. He adds: “I consider declining suicide rates [in many other countries] to be somewhat of a baseline, considering advances in medicine and psychiatry, which is why constant or increasing rates in spite of such advances stand out.”</p>

<p><em><span>The African Development Bank (AfDB) was established in 1964 to guide the continent onto a path of sustainable pan-African economic growth and reduce poverty. Heading its efforts is Mthuli Ncube, chief economist and vice president at the multilateral bank, which is temporarily headquartered in Tunisia.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>From a prime vantage point to observe the issues and effects brought by the Arab Spring, Ncube and the African Development Bank are focusing on infrastructure development and addressing youth unemployment to stem the ebbing tide of discontent — alongside the Middle East, Africa is home to one of the youngest populations in the world.</span></em></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><em><span>Not surprisingly, North Africa’s GDP grew by only 0.5% last year in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. Since the region is responsible for around one-third of Africa’s overall GDP, it lowered the entire continent’s GDP by one percentage point. Ncube is guiding the bank’s decisions to boost Africa’s economic growth in light of its significant challenges.</span></em></p>
<p><span>An edited transcript of the conversation follows.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>One of the biggest investment goals for AfDB is in infrastructure. Can you talk about some of the complexities of infrastructure projects? Which countries need infrastructure loans the most and how did Africa fall behind in infrastructure development?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mthuli Ncube:</span></strong> <span>The infrastructure sector is one of the key operational areas of the bank. Approvals in 2010 for infrastructure projects amounted to UA 2.60 billion, representing 70.9% of all bank group loan and grant approvals for the year — the largest sectorial allocation. The bank selectively targets high-impact projects in its infrastructure portfolio, to stimulate an investment-friendly climate, strengthen regional member countries’ (RMCs) competitiveness and productivity, create jobs, and promote sustainable economic growth. In particular, the bank is well-placed to lend its support to large, transboundary infrastructure projects and programs that promote regional integration. The prioritization of infrastructure not only in the Medium-Term Strategy (MTS), but also in RMCs’ national agendas, demonstrates the crucial role that modern, reliable, and affordable infrastructure plays in achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.</span></p>
<p><span>All the RMCs need infrastructure and the bank provides both loans and grants to finance infrastructure development. Africa fell behind in infrastructure development because of underinvestment in the sector. Confining infrastructure development in African low-income countries to mostly public financing sources has left their infrastructure needs unaddressed. The vast infrastructure gap has limited their growth potential and in some cases also impeded achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, the landscape of infrastructure financing in Africa has changed in recent years. Recognizing the infrastructure gap as an opportunity, both domestic private investors and emerging partners, scaled up their investment in Africa’s infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>One of your goals has been to emphasize the importance of the role of women. How are you able to do that as a multilateral bank?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>The bank has a gender and social development monitoring division that was established to ensure the quality-at-entry of operations and better results monitoring. In addition, gender is mainstreamed in bank operations across various sectors and at all stages of the project lifecycle. During 2010, for the first time, the bank included gender equality in quality assurance and monitoring. Gender equality is being mainstreamed into the new supervision reporting format, the new operations manual, and the revised CPIA rating system. In addition, following a trial run during the course of the year, the bank developed a gender results tracking system that proposes gender equality as a new quality-at-entry standard to be included in the readiness review. The bank produced Country Gender Profiles and conducted assessments of gender mainstreaming in social and human development, and gender-responsive budgeting. It also mainstreamed gender equality in some policies, including the bank’s new energy policy. Gender specialists in operations and in quality assurance and results monitoring assisted in raising the quality of operations by participating in the project-cycle activities, Country Strategy Papers (CSPs), and other country dialogue work.</span></p>
<p><span>The bank funds and co-organizes the Africa Women’s Economic Summit that is an annual event. The Summit is a forum for businesswomen, bankers, and politicians to discuss the challenges and opportunities of expanding women’s access to financial products and decision-making.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>In 2012, the theme was to promote youth employment since that issue has loomed large in the Arab Spring unrest. How does such a large labor problem get addressed?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>The African Economic Outlook 2012 has a special theme that focuses on promoting youth employment that is among the mid-term challenges that require resolute action from African policymakers. Creating productive employment for Africa’s rapidly growing young population is an immense challenge, but also the key to future prosperity. Youth unemployment has become a security threat to the social, economic and political stability of nations. Young people face real and increasing difficulty in finding decent work with each passing day. Over the course of the past year and half, youth-led movement calling for "social justice, freedom and jobs" was ignited by Mohamed Boazizi, a street vendor in Tunisia, picked up by young Egyptians in Tahrir Square, followed by the revolution in Libya, and spread to Europe, passing through Madrid and Greece, reaching Wall Street and becoming the "Occupy" movement.</span></p>
<p><span>Turning our attention to Africa, with almost 200 million people aged between 15 and 24, Africa has the youngest population in the world and, by 2030, nearly one in four young people will be African. This presents Africa with an enormous opportunity — but it could also present a significant risk and threat to social cohesion and political stability if Africa fails to create sufficient economic and employment opportunities to support decent living conditions for this group. Over the last decade, Africa has seen an unparalleled and sustained improvement in growth, with more countries registering annual growth of 5% a year or more. Between 2000 and 2010, six of the world’s 10 fastest growing economies were in Africa. However in most cases, this growth has not generated the number of jobs necessary to absorb the 10 to 12 million young, and increasingly educated, people entering the labor market each year. Governments have found it difficult to bridge the gap between economic growth and job creation. This raises profound policy implications for African governments in terms of economic inclusion, social cohesion, and global competitiveness.</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><span>Promoting youth employment remains at the forefront of Africa’s development agenda. Africa’s young population is rapidly increasing and getting more educated with demand for quality jobs and better livelihood. Turning this youth bulge into an effective human capital will require steely implementation of reforms to foster employment opportunities. Past growth has not been sufficiently employment intensive. Therefore, a stronger focus on employment enhancing growth is necessary. Both demand and supply policy measures and more flexible policy response to labor market dynamics will be needed to address the problem. The relatively stabilized economic and political situation in Africa provides an opportunity to reset the policy agenda of African governments toward an inclusive, employment generating and sustainable growth strategy.</span></p>
<p><span>The bank is addressing this challenge through its long-term strategy. The long-term strategy on inclusive growth could provide wider access to economic opportunities and creation of productive employment for the youth.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Africa’s growth was affected by the political uprisings in North Africa with 3.4% growth in 2011. In your report, the growth rate is expected to rebound to 4.5 % in 2012 and then 4.8 % in 2013. Does that still stand?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>In 2011, Africa continued to recover from the adverse effects of the global crisis and remained amongst the fastest growing regions of the world. After a strong rebound of 5 % in 2010, GDP grew by 3.4% in 2011. The latter displays important regional differences in performance. North Africa, for example, grew by only 0.5% as economies settled down after the political changes. Sub-Saharan African economies grew by more than 5%, although the figure is much higher when South Africa, which grew at 3.1 %, is excluded. With the recovery of North African economies and sustained improvement in other regions, growth across the continent is expected to accelerate to 4.5 % in 2012 and 4.8 % in 2013. The bank is giving much attention to Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, which are middle-income countries. After their uprisings, the new governments must establish political stability and improve economic and social conditions. Given North Africa’s weight of around a third of the continent’s GDP, the economic disruption in the region reduced Africa’s growth in 2011 by more than one percentage point. The projected recovery of the region will boost Africa’s growth in 2012 by almost the same amount.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>I read an article where you were quoted as saying that 40 % of agricultural produce perishes on the way to market. What kind of pan-African strategy is necessary to overcome such travesties?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>Africa’s smallholder farmers have been unable to realize profitable returns on their investments due to high post-harvest losses. Programs such as the Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) through their market access program is addressing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Pan-African strategy that AGRA is implementing includes increasing the commercial orientation of smallholder farmers by bringing producers together and reducing market barriers. As they become more commercial, smallholders will produce more marketable surpluses and raise their incomes. More food on the market at reasonable prices will in turn boost food security.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, encouraging the availability of affordable financing for smallholder producers, without which they cannot make income-earning changes to their operations. Burgeoning microfinance institutions and innovative banks are increasingly trying to serve this market segment.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, reducing price volatility by improving produce storage options for smallholders. Carefully designed and well-run warehouse receipt systems are an important way of enabling farmers to sell their product at times when better prices prevail. Such systems also increase the ability of smallholders to borrow funds, using their stored produce as security.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How has the AfDB been affected by the Arab Spring?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>The African Development Bank must learn from the momentous changes currently underway in the region, understand their underlying causes and make adjustments as appropriate to our interventions. This will be done through close consultation with our clients to ensure that we provide the best possible support for the betterment of the lives of the people in the region. In particular, as we finance different operations, we will ensure that rural and disenfranchised regions are integrated and pay particular attention to the creation of meaningful jobs. Ours is a long-term commitment and we remain engaged in this important region especially during this critical time.</span></p>
<p><span>In Tunisia for example, the bank in 2011 approved the Social Inclusion and Transition Support Program (SITSP). This is a multi-donor emergency budget support operation to restore socioeconomic stability to the country. The bank contributed UA 308.5 million toward this program, which was co-financed with other development partners, including the World Bank, the European Union (EU), and the Agence francaise de developpement (AFD). The program is in direct response to the popular demands voiced during the revolution for more jobs, greater equity between the sub regions, fuller democratic participation by citizens, and increased transparency in the governance of the country. Addressing all these issues will contribute to a restoration of socioeconomic stability and to a smooth democratic transition in Tunisia.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>The AfDB used the term "youthquake" to describe the young people who helped start the revolutions. With the new governments put in place, how have the youth unemployment issues been addressed?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>The events in North Africa have brought to the forefront the plight of Africa’s youth. Young Africans find themselves excluded from the labor market and the formal economy. While access to education has expanded, those who succeed within the education system have even less prospect of finding gainful employment than those with no education at all. In a world that has now been shrunk by mass communications, Africa’s young people are all too aware how their counterparts are living on other continents. They are aware that China and India are surging ahead faster than Africa. In short, the gap between expectations and economic opportunities has widened. Promoting inclusive growth that creates opportunities and ensuring equal access to them is one way of addressing the youth-unemployment problem.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>How has the AfDB been affected by the global recession?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>In recent years, Africa’s growth has become broader-based. In 2011, despite some decline from their peak, commodity prices remained favorable for exporters. Rising export volumes of commodities and manufactured goods have been important drivers of growth. But in some countries, exports weakened due to lower growth in important trading partners. Africa’s growing middle-class continues to boost consumption. Inflows of remittances and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) also supported domestic demand in many countries.</span></p>
<p><span>The continued economic crisis in the euro area may reduce demand for African exports, while lowering external resource inflows further, including remittances. Africa’s economic prospects depend on many unpredictable factors. A deeper Eurozone crisis would cause a pronounced global weakening and a more pessimistic scenario for growth. For Africa, this could cause lower earnings from exports and tourism, contagion effects for African banks, lower inflows of official development assistance, foreign direct investment and worker’s remittances. The fallout on trade appears to be the biggest risk. The overall effect on Africa would depend on the depth and duration of the crisis in Europe and how much it touches the rest of the global economy.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>One food economist, Professor Tyler Cowen at George Mason University, said that the EU’s non-acceptance of genetically modified products is inhibiting Africa’s agricultural trade. What are your thoughts on that subject?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>It is contended that by 2060, the green revolution will be supplanted by a gene revolution. Since the early 1980s, modern biotechnology has led to increasing knowledge of the scientific procedures needed to utilize gene-based techniques to improve agriculture. Agricultural biotechnology has the potential to transform African agriculture by raising agricultural productivity and farmers’ incomes. The potential benefits include yield increases in the staple food crops produced in tropical and semi-tropical environments, the creation of drought- and pest-resistant varieties, and shorter harvesting cycles, enabling the planting of several crops per season. Genetic engineering also enables cost-saving techniques, such as nitrogen fixation. Biotechnology offers the possibility of developing varieties and techniques that reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. For example, new crop varieties can, in some cases, contribute to a dramatic reduction in herbicide usage. It can also help create new cultivars with increased resistance to biotic stresses, increasing the possibility of farming with fewer inputs of water and energy. Biotech cotton, which is resistant to the often-devastating bollworm insect, for example, raised yields 29% in India, and contributed to a 78% increase in income for many of the country’s poorest farmers. Enhanced varieties of corn have boosted yields worldwide — by as much as 61% over traditional varieties in the Philippines.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Rising food prices are a major problem for low-wage earners. What can be done to protect people from such volatile market pricing?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>Rising food prices continue to be a major concern for inflationary trends. The rising global food prices have been accompanied by increasing volatility. The increasing frequency and magnitude of food price volatility has worsened food insecurity for Africa’s poor population. To address these problems in the short term, increased investment in safety nets and social protection are required to reduce the vulnerability of the poor especially smallholder farmers. Such social safety nets would allow quick distribution of cash in the event of a sudden and steep rise in food prices. In the long term, enhancing agricultural productivity together with mitigating and adapting to climate change should be the primary focus of initiatives to achieve food security.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Arabic Knowledge@Wharton:</span></strong> <span>Recently, AfDB came out with a plan about what Africa will look like in the next 50 years. Can you tell us what that’ll be and what is the roadmap to get there?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>The balance of evidence suggests that the next half century offers good prospects for realizing an African vision of a dynamic, diversified and competitive economic zone in which extreme poverty is eliminated within peaceful, stable and vibrant societies. This vision involves the transformation of fragile and vulnerable African economies into more robust and developed market, creating opportunities for the poor and leading to peaceful, stable and vibrant societies.</span></p>
<p><span>Recent evidence shows that economic growth in Africa is generally strong, fuelled in large measure by business-enabling policy reforms, more favorable commodity prices and a marked improvement in peace and security. African Development Bank (AfDB) estimates suggest that both Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita will increase steadily throughout the period 2010 to 2060. By 2060, most African countries will attain upper middle-income status and the extreme forms of poverty will have been eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the outcomes of Africa’s strong economic growth in the past two decades has been a significant increase in the size of the African middle class, defined as earnings of between US$4 and US$20 per day. The middle class will continue to grow, from 355 million, which is 34 % of Africa’s population, in 2010 to 1.1 billion, which will be 42 % in 2060. Conversely, poverty levels are expected to fall, with the proportion of the population living on less than US$1.25 a day declining from 44 % in 2010 to 33.3 % in 2060.</span></p>
<p><span>Africa’s development outcomes for the coming decades will be determined by a number of drivers of change, and the policy changes adopted by African countries in response to changing world conditions. These drivers of change will be global, physical and human. Cumulatively, they will create dramatic changes for the continent and the global environment with which it interacts. Its prospects for development will in turn depend on the policies Africa implements to take advantage of its vibrant young population, its abundant natural resources and its considerable human capital.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Ncube:</span></strong> <span>Education reforms are essential to improving the skills and problem-solving capacity of workers and to restoring public confidence in social mobility and inter-generational equity. To prepare young Africans for the market place of the 21st-century, the priority should be on science and technology and vocational training by strengthening apprenticeships and other vocational training programs for low-skilled youths. In addition, countries should mainstream entrepreneurship development into the school and university curricula.</span></p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/1724_4_English.jpg" alt=""></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span lang="EN-US">London School of Economics professor Danny Quah recently delivered an address on “Life in Unequal Growing Economies”, as part of the Singapore Management University School of Economics Distinguished Lecture Series. He presented an empirical model to measure the trade-offs between economic growth and income inequality, and to assess the implications of such trade-offs for an individual’s welfare. Knowledge@SMU spoke to Quah about the wider implications of his research in developing economies.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> How would you describe your research findings and their implications for ordinary people in developing countries?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> We live in a world where there is great inequality across different parts of the world, where prosperity has been brought to significant chunks of it but, at the same time, a huge fraction of the world’s population remains very, very poor. In the views of some, high growth rates are accompanied by high and rising levels of inequality. The question that I tried to address is: how much of the improvement in the human condition can we trace back to changes in economic growth, and how much of the deterioration in human welfare is due to fact that there is inequality in society? It is a question of measuring the state of the human condition globally and, simultaneously, from the perspective of economic growth and inequality.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span lang="EN-US">What my research tries to do is use a mathematical model to calibrate or estimate the relative importance of these different, large global forces. What it concludes is that, if you are really concerned about alleviating poverty, economic growth is unambiguously a good thing. It is a powerful locomotive for bringing poor people out of poverty. The effect of inequality is very much secondary. One bottom line, therefore, is that economic growth is good — almost regardless of how much rising inequality accompanies it — given how, historically, inequality and growth have evolved. Now there might be extreme circumstances that the world has not yet experienced and that might overturn this conclusion, but based on the last 25 to 50 years of recorded world history, we have to conclude that growth is the single most powerful force for lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Do you follow the conventional definition that equates welfare with economic efficiency and equitable income distribution?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">That definition presupposes some answers and it takes certain things as given. I don’t calculate human welfare that way. Instead, I approach it from the perspective of an individual in society who enjoys different kinds of patterns in consumption. Somebody living in a fast-growing society can reasonably expect that his or her consumption will rise over time. I proceed from a level of individual welfare and then ask the question, given the patterns of growth and inequality that we see out there, how important are these different factors for how well off someone is? I don’t tackle the much more difficult question of social welfare that you defined as economic efficiency and some variant of income inequality.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Everyone would like to live in an egalitarian society. Aren’t the effects of changes in income distribution on welfare too obvious to be measured?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">We could debate that. I think that some very reasonable people hold the view that income inequality in society does affect the individual. All else equal, someone living in a highly unequal society feels worse off than someone living in an egalitarian society.That is not unreasonable as an </span><i><span lang="EN-US">a priori</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> possibility. But it is very, very difficult to put reasonable numbers on that. You and I can sit here and debate if it is 20 times the weight of growth, or 2000, but there is no evidence we can bring to bear on that either way.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span lang="EN-US">So I take the opposite extreme position, but which we might again debate as being just as bad. In my own mind, I say that, while that possibility might be there, I am not going to consider it. So in effect I put zero weight on it. In this regard, I follow what is conventional practice among certain groups of economists. We don’t look at altruistic concerns. We look at individualistic concerns.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">You have said that this isa consequence-based paper and not a causality-based one. But do you think there may be different implications or consequences for welfare depending whether inequality causes growth or vice-versa?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Yes, there is a possibility that if the causality were of an extreme form then it might overturn my conclusions. But, paradoxically, I take comfort in how so much research has gone into trying to disentangle the causality between growth and inequality, and yet found nothing strongly systematic. If there were such an extreme possibility with regard to causality, then it would surely have been discovered by now.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">What about envy arising from inequality? Do you think it may have negative implications for welfare?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Envy raises interesting sociological issues. Arguably, in medieval times inequality was much higher than it is now. Royalty owned 90% of all the wealth.  The poor worked themselves to death and were taxed. When countries went to war, it was royalty attacking other royalty using the brawn, muscle, and lives of ordinary workers. People’s mindsets were such that they tolerated this in those days, but they would not stand for such behavior today.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span lang="EN-US">So what is it that people envy? Sometimes, perhaps for light relief, I fall back onto figures from the cinema for explanations. Take, for instance, what we might call the Hannibal Lecter theory of envy. In “Silence of the Lambs”, while talking to Clarice about the serial killer she is investigating, Lecter explains, “You envy what you see everyday. You can only be envious of things you think are within your grasp. How do we begin to covet? Do we seek out things to covet? We begin by coveting the things we see everyday.”  When royalty was the cause of inequality, most of human society thought such wealth was beyond reach. But now we see ordinary people becoming spectacularly rich. This generates two sets of forces. On the one hand, we have aspiration and mobility which creates growth and allows societies to live with high levels of inequality because everyone feels that, at some point, he or she will get a piece of the action. On the other hand, there is the increasing level of envy in society and the media has a role to play here. The world’s rich are on display, and every schoolboy thinks that it could happen to him. The world of inequality, envy, and social cohesion is changing in ways that economics is obviously not yet coming to grips with.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">As there is no single aggregate to measure how inequality affects welfare, is this one of the reasons why growth matters more than inequality?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Yes, that’s right. Part of the reason is also that growth is like the tide that comes into a harbour. When it comes in powerfully, that tide lifts all the boats. Some boats are lifted a bit higher than others but the force of the tide lifts them all. It is the sheer magnitude of this force that makes growth much more important than inequality.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">An important basis of your research is the trade-off between growth and inequality. Empirically, high growth rates are accompanied by high rates of income inequality. What is the future of countries like China?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">I suppose, implicit in my own thinking, is that such rapid increases in inequality will not continue. It will never be the case that two or three people end up owning everything in society, and everybody else is destitute. I’d imagine some natural bound operates on how unequal societies can get. On the other hand, I see no natural bound on how much societies can grow.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">In your discussion, you also talk about one of the least progressive regions – sub-Saharan Africa. Would it even be appropriate to talk about inequality and its implications in these countries?<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">I agree that the much more pressing problem in sub-Saharan Africa is that of absolute poverty. Talking about relative poverty or income inequality just misses the point. Literacy is low. Epidemic HIV-AIDS is rampant. Even basic needs like access to clean water are not yet met. Such chronic poverty is the first-order problem that needs to be addressed there before we even talk about inequality. The tide of growth needs to lift them to a higher basic level before anything else becomes meaningful.<br><br></span></p><br>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><span lang="EN-US">Knowledge@SMU: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Would your theory also apply to the education industry with its tremendous growth and correspondingly high levels of inequality?<br><br></span></p><b><span lang="EN-US">Quah: </span></b><span lang="EN-US">That is a very interesting insight, I hadn’t thought of it that way. Certainly for education, it is useful to think about how these ideas might apply to the streaming of students into different channels of study at a very young age in schools in Malaysia and Singapore. Such a policy increases the measured inequality and it raises performance or efficiency. But then we are back in the discussion of what the trade-off is between inequality and growth.</span>

					<div class="article_the_content">
						<p>Earlier this year, things were looking bright for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although analysts had predicted a decline in the country’s GDP by 2%-4% because of the <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/demonetization-india-will-pay-price/">fallout from demonetization</a>, GDP growth numbers for the third quarter of 2016-2017 (October-December) came in at 7.0% — enough to maintain India’s status as the fastest-growing large economy in the world.</p>
<p>Since then, it seems that the tables have turned. The growth rate of India’s economy declined to 5.7% in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, and Modi is now under attack by former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who published an op-ed criticizing the effectiveness of Modi’s government in <em>The Indian Express</em>. “I shall be failing in my national duty if I did not speak up even now against the mess the finance minister has made of the economy,” he wrote. In addition to highlighting the decline in growth, he noted: “Private investment has shrunk as never before in two decades, industrial production has all but collapsed, agriculture is in distress.” Moreover, Sinha added, “demonetization has proved to be an unmitigated economic disaster, a badly conceived and poorly implemented GST (Goods and Services Tax) has played havoc with businesses and sunk many of them, and countless millions have lost their jobs with hardly any new opportunities coming the way of the new entrants to the labor market.”</p>
<p>Opposition parties were quick to jump on the bandwagon. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Fasten your seatbelt … wings have fallen off our plane.”</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>But have they?</p>
<p>“There is an old Latin phrase, ‘Cui bono?’ — Who benefits?” says <a target="_blank" href="http://dci.stanford.edu/jitendra-jv-singh/">Jitendra V. Singh,</a> emeritus professor of management at Wharton and 2017 fellow, Distinguished Careers Institute, Stanford University. “From any position being taken in public discourse, we should ask, who benefits from this? … I do not believe that the data shows India is in an economic crisis. Yes, GDP growth may have slowed recently. This was to be expected. While the long-term effects of the introduction of GST are going to be quite positive — indeed, some positive results are already showing up in the form of higher tax collections — there was bound to be a short-term disruption.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“If GDP growth during October-December is under 7%, that would clearly be a worrisome figure. Let’s hope it’s not.” <span class="attribution">–<a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/kartikh/" target="_blank">Kartik Hosanagar</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>While it makes sense to look at the short-term data, Singh notes, “what really matters is what happens over a period of three-to-five years. Some of the statistics that could be considered if one wants to examine the strength of the economy and foreign confidence in the India story are GDP growth rate, inflation, fiscal deficit, current account deficit, foreign reserves, and FDI inflows.”</p>
<p>Speaking at a function in New Delhi, Modi acknowledged that the GDP growth rate had fallen in the first quarter of the current fiscal. But, he said, it had been much lower in the previous Congress-led regime. Sunil Mittal, chairman of India’s largest telecom service provider Bharti Airtel, told a World Economic Forum meeting in Delhi: “A 6% to 7% growth in any place in the world would be a cause for a great deal of jealousy.”</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has pared India’s growth forecast for 2017-2018 but expects a revival which will help India win the title of the fastest-growing large economy back from China. The Indian economy will grow 6.7% in fiscal 2018 against the 7.2% estimated earlier, according to the latest IMF World Economic Outlook. Fiscal 2019 growth is projected at 7.4% against the earlier 7.7%.</p>

<p>Two days after the Reserve Bank of India issued its monetary policy statement on October 4, RBI Governor Urjit Patel told business daily <em>Mint</em> that “GDP growth would pick up in the third and fourth quarters [of the current fiscal year] to above 7%.”</p>
<p>“If GDP growth during October-December is under 7%, that would clearly be a worrisome figure,” says <a target="_blank" href="http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~kartikh/">Kartik Hosanagar</a>, Wharton professor of operations and decisions. “But let’s hope it’s not. In my opinion, the most important GDP measure for the Modi government will be the October-December quarter and the first quarter of 2018. This is partly because enough time would have passed by then so we can separate out short-term shocks because things like GST will be less relevant by then.”</p>
<p>“What is the appropriate time period to evaluate the results produced by a particular policy action?” asks Singh. “Fundamental changes, especially structural changes, take time to fully show results. We should not mistake short-term disruptions for trends. It is a mistake to think that there is some magical, perfect way to run a large-scale complex system like an economy.”</p>
<p>Still, “the growth slowdown is clearly a huge challenge for Modi and his finance minister,” notes Hosanagar. “Even traders and businessmen — some of Modi’s core supporters — seem to be unhappy with the changes they need to make to be compliant with the new GST norms. While the idea of sales tax reform was rather good and very bold, there have been execution challenges. There were similar execution issues with demonetization. The most critical question right now is how much of the decline in the most recent quarter is due to demonetization versus GST versus reduced lending by banks versus impact of prior bad loans, etc.? … [We] need to separate out short-term shocks — which were expected — from long-term impact.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Modi claims both demonetization and the GST have delivered. Teething problems linked to the GST and bandwidth constraints may get resolved relatively soon, allowing growth to accelerate in the second half, the RBI noted in its October policy statement. “On the downside, a faster than expected rise in input costs and the lack of pricing power may put further pressure on corporate margins, affecting value added by industry.” The policy left the repo rate (the rate at which the central bank lends) unchanged at 6.0%. India has one of the highest repo rates in the world; in the U.S., it is around 0.80%.</p>

<p>“There is disproportionate attention being paid in the media to recent events like demonetization and implementation of the GST,” says <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/raviaron/"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/raviaron/" target="_blank">Ravi Aron</a>, a professor of information systems at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. “These are, at worst, speed bumps, and neither has any structural impact on the economy.”</p>
<p>The intense focus placed on demonetization and the GST “obscures the real problems that the economy faces – the structural factors, which will stop sustained high rates of growth,” Aron says. “These need to be removed.”</p>
<p>According to Aron, the structural factors that need addressing include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The banking system:</strong> “Many of the state-owned banks have significant non-performing assets,” Aron points out. “The talk is of consolidating these banks. Instead they should be recapitalized and sold…. In 2016, loans to industry were growing at a meager 2% — a level that cannot support growth rates. Without the debilitating control of the government, these banks will perform their primary function – route capital to where it produces optimal returns and price risk efficiently.”</li>
<li><strong>State-owned enterprises:</strong> “Every government since Independence has sought to have the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) capture the commanding heights of the economy. This has slowed in 1991 after the reforms, but the Indian economy continues to suffer from the strangulating hold of these SOEs and the capital that they have locked up.”</li>
<li><strong>The labor market</strong>: “There are over 250 laws having to do with labor and employment. The invidious Industrial Disputes Act has done significant damage to the emergence of an efficient labor market,” Aron says. “About 10% of Indian labor is in the organized sector while the remaining 90% works in the ‘informal sector’ that has no benefits, no pensions or even salary growth tied to inflation. The act prevents retrenchment of labor and makes it highly unattractive to hire employees in the organized sector.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Adds Aron: “Until we tackle these issues, a more honest name for the ‘Make in India’ campaign should be ‘Make in Spite of India.’”</p>
<p><strong>Gas, Inflation and Unemployment</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the GDP growth, what are additional signals that the economy is not doing well? Investments, for one. Presently, the private sector is facing <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/insolvency-india-essar-group-others-digging-deep-funds/">a wall of unpaid loans</a>. This amounts to Rs.10 lakh crore ($154 billion), which it can’t or won’t pay back — so it has no money to invest. The alternative is for the government to increase spending, through a fiscal stimulus perhaps. But that means widening the fiscal deficit, another bugbear for the critics.</p>
<p>Relaxing the fiscal target may not be the answer. “India’s economic history is replete with the same lessons,” says a report by banking and financial services firm JPMorgan. “Every time policymakers trade off some macroeconomic stability for growth, the economy ends up with neither. The current government has heeded these lessons remarkably well, and shown admirable fiscal restraint. We shouldn’t blemish that record now.”</p>
<p>Many of the other parameters seem to be ticking along. The dollar, after gaining strength against the rupee, has come down. And India’s forex reserves were at a record $402.25 billion as of September 22.</p>
<p>That may pay off later — as will Modi’s broader social schemes, including power for all, spreading the reach of banking, and clean India. But the person on the street is likely thinking more about today’s problems. One is high gas prices: Central levies have kept rates to the consumer high despite falling international crude prices. Another is retail inflation, which in August shot up 3.36% — the highest in five months.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is disproportionate attention being paid in the media to recent events like demonetization and implementation of the GST…. [Neither] has any structural impact on the economy.” <span class="attribution">–Ravi Aron</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Jobs are an even bigger concern. One of Modi’s election promises was the creation of 10 million jobs. “The total number of jobs created in the first three years of the BJP government … [is] 1.51 million, nearly 39% less than the 2.47 million created during the three previous years,” according to <em>Hindustan Times</em>. Adds <em>Mint</em>: “The unemployment rate in India has shot up to a five-year high of 5% in 2015-2016, with the figure significantly higher at 8.7% for women as compared to 4.3% for men. The figures could be an alarm bell for the BJP-ruled government at the centre.”</p>
<p>“Modi has a jobs problem, and it could darken his road towards [re-election in] 2019,” says the <em>Economic Times</em>. “The opposition — in disarray since losing to Modi — is dialing up its criticism as it eyes elections.”</p>
<p>“In my opinion, only time will tell whether the ‘slowdown’ will affect Modi’s prospects in the 2019 General Elections,” says Singh. The same goes for predicting how the current challenges will impact the overall economy, he adds. “Instead of hoping to fashion an economic crisis out of thin air, it behooves all to refrain from gratuitous criticism, and focus more on the facts — and to give more time before asking whether a policy or strategy has failed. An economy or society is like a large ship. It cannot be turned in a different direction in a matter of quarters or months. It takes years, if not decades.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The issue of trade is particularly germane as countries around the world try to dig themselves out of the economic crisis — a crisis that is truly, and unprecedentedly, global in nature. <i>The Economist</i> issued a stark warning on February 5, 2009, to countries that would respond to the crisis by closing their borders to trade:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“[T]he reemergence of a specter from the darkest period of modern history argues for a different, indeed strident response. Economic nationalism — the urge to keep jobs and capital at home — is both turning the economic crisis into a political one and threatening the world with depression. If it is not buried again forthwith, the consequences will be dire.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It’s a warning that 2004 Nobel Laureate and W. P. Carey School professor of economics Edward Prescott echoed at the first of three forums on trade, China and the world economic order hosted by the W. P. Carey School of Business, ASU’s Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law and the The Kearny Alliance. Prescott opened the forum’s discussion by declaring that “economic integration is the path to riches and peace.” Replacing the word “trade” with “economic integration” in that statement reflects a much broader, more complex relationship, according to Prescott.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Developing countries (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) that have economically integrated with industrial leaders like the U.S. have caught up with those leaders in terms of GDP. Those five Asian countries averaged 31% of the U.S.’s GDP per capita level in 1961, but had advanced to 67% by 2001. Yet the opposite is also true. In Latin America, for example, countries are not “catching up” economically because they’re not economically integrated with one another, Prescott explained.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Economic integration drives economic growth in developing countries for four reasons, Prescott said. First, through economic integration, the less-developed country (China, for example) gets access to foreign know-how — technological capital — which it can then adopt to become more productive. “Multinational companies use their technological know-how in their foreign subsidiaries, so reciprocal multinational relationships are key — they lead to a vested interest in both countries to remaining open,” Prescott said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Second, if development is constrained within a country’s own economy (the country is not economically integrated), then productivity increases growing out of better technology lead to decreased employment (as more efficient production requires fewer workers). But, if development can spill outside the country’s own economy, then productivity increases lead to increased output<i> and</i> increased employment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Third, economic integration allows a more rapid diffusion of knowledge — which is key to productivity growth. “A lot of technological capital has to be absorbed person-to-person,” Prescott said, “and that happens more quickly if countries are economically integrated.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Finally, economic integration invites competition, which Prescott calls “a powerful motivator for economic development.” When the first six European Union countries integrated, he said, the mere threat of competition in France from German firms led French firms to become more productive.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">The More Integration, the Better?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">W. P. Carey School of Business dean Robert Mittelstaedt recounted a conversation he had with a New York City cab driver, who plainly stated his opinion that the U.S. shouldn’t trade with China because “we need to keep jobs in the U.S.” Mittelstaedt asked the driver if he enjoyed paying low prices at Wal-Mart. “Of course,” was the answer. “Those lower prices are a direct result of trade with China,” Mittelstaedt replied. Though his logic was clearly breaking down, the cab driver stood his ground that, simply, American policymakers should do everything they can to keep U.S. jobs in the U.S.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Indeed, the perception that economic integration is only good for one of the countries is common in the U.S., but Prescott said that more integration is better for everyone. If economic leadership is a club, “we all gain from having more people in the club.” He forecasts that by 2100 the whole world will be rich — because of economic integration.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Contrary to popular opinion, Prescott argued, the pie grows bigger as more countries come to the table. “The set of industrial leaders is expanding. Once a country is in that club, it stays in.” In other words, the economic development of China won’t hurt the U.S. “In the category of economic superpowers, more is better than less — the more technology those leaders develop, the more we all benefit.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But even among the forum participants, significant debate erupted over the idea that economic integration benefits all — that it makes the pie bigger, rather than simply enlarging some countries’ slices and shrinking others’. </span><span lang="EN-US">Perhaps even more significant, some suggested, is the concern that pursuing economic development and measuring that development only by GDP may be unsustainable given the earth’s finite resources.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“It’s easier for economists to calculate the gains from trade than it is to calculate the costs. Adjustment costs associated with economic integration are underrepresented economically,” said Clyde Prestowitz, Jr., founder and president of the Economic Strategy Institute.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Paul Schiff Berman, dean of the College of Law, pointed out that we may need to think of trade within a broader regulatory framework that focuses on how China and the United States can best pursue their mutual need for an economic model that is stable, sustainable and promotes human flourishing.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Merle Hinrichs, chairman and CEO of Global Sources, articulated some of the costs — and benefits — from both the American and Chinese </span><span lang="EN-US">business and consumer</span><span lang="EN-US"> perspectives. Among the benefits China receives from economic integration are capital investment and knowledge transfer (of everything from technology to management). Among the costs, from China’s perspective, are dependencies on trade-related jobs and adverse environmental impacts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">From the American perspective, Hinrichs cited substantial consumer product choice and highly competitive consumer product prices (which contribute to slower inflation growth) as benefits of economic integration with China. Costs include a substantial trade deficit, dependencies on foreign capital, dependencies on imports, and job losses, which, especially in today’s economy, have come to the fore as the primary reason behind calls for the U.S. to back off economic integration with China.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Sticking Points: Terms of Integration</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Defining the pros and cons of economic integration is likely not the most difficult task, Prestowitz suggested. “Economic integration is obviously important — that’s easy to say. But part of the issue is the ‘how’ of integration — that’s the key question in globalization, especially in the U.S.-China relationship.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mittelstaedt suggested that the problems we face with trade today are similar to those faced throughout history; trading partners say, “I want what you have but I’m not sure I want to trade with you on an even basis.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">That’s certainly been part of the history of trade in the U.S. “The United States integrated economically on its own terms,” said Prestowitz. During the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries, the U.S. pursued “catch-up” policies that included highly protective measures. President Lincoln, for example, increased tariffs 60 %. Teddy Roosevelt said, “Thank God I’m not a free trader.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Protectionist policies were designed to help the United States catch up, developmentally, with then-leader Great Britain. At the same time, Britain, which led the Industrial Revolution, felt free to pursue laissez faire (“hands off”) trade policies. But in the late 19th century, countries like the United States — following policies much like the Asian developing countries follow today — caught up with and eventually surpassed the UK. (In 1888, per capita GDP in the U.S. was 85% of the UK’s. By 1908, U.S. per capita GDP had risen to 103% of the UK’s.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">By 1946, the U.S. was the dominant player in global trade — the most productive in every industry and the technological leader. The U.S. was, in other words, the “new Britain.” As the new leader, the U.S. followed a path similar to the UK’s — adopting a much more laissez faire trade policy and developing a “trade not aid” mantra designed to get war-torn countries back on their feet through exports to the U.S. Domestically, the U.S. focused on developing consumption to lead growth and stimulate exports from other countries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“For the last 60 years, this has been the U.S. strategy — not entirely laissez faire, but a fairly open market approach to trade and investment, with a priority focus on domestic consumption as the global growth driver,” Prestowitz said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Chinese Economic Integration<i></i></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Like the U.S. in the early 20th century, China is now moving up the “value ladder” — from low-value, labor-intensive manufacturing to higher value, higher technology manufacturing (and, eventually, services). Since 1978, when the country moved to a decentralized, market-oriented arrangement, it has been in a period of rapid economic catch-up, what Prescott called a “growth miracle.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In 2001, China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), after which “someone turned the switch and the flow of FDI [foreign direct investment] accelerated rapidly,” as Hinrichs put it. Foreign-invested enterprises dominated state-owned enterprises in China’s export markets. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">That meant foreign companies entering China with their technological knowledge and management know-how. “Today, China has developed its own stock of those types of capital; now Chinese companies are themselves looking to locate in foreign countries and even buy foreign brands,” Hinrichs said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Like Japan, which is now considered an industrial leader, China and other developing Asian countries are pursuing catch-up strategies marked by suppressed consumption, which generates high rates of savings and the capital the countries need to invest in economic development. “In Singapore, for example, the savings rate is 55% (compared to 1% to 3% in the U.S.). The country then channels those savings into particular industries to increase productivity and increase living standards,” said Prestowitz.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The big question today is whether or not China will join the “club” of industrial leaders. To be considered an industrial leader, Prescott said, a country must have a per capita GDP that is at least 50% of the top country’s per capita GDP. Today, China is certainly catching up, but isn’t there yet — in 2008, per capita GDP in China was 22% of per capita GDP in the U.S. (up from 13% from just seven years earlier).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Prescott</span><span lang="EN-US"> said that China will join the club in 2025 <i>if </i>the country’s economy grows at 7% a year until then <i>and</i> becomes more economically integrated with the advanced industrialized countries. Once in the club, China will be a member for life, Prescott said. “It’s an expanding set — countries that get in, stay in.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">The Sustainability of Global Integration</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The idea that an ever-greater number of countries would join the “economic leadership club,” characterized by relatively high levels of per capita GDP and — often — consumption, worried many forum participants. In other words, if China’s per capita GDP comes to rival the U.S.’s, and per capita consumption follows, what are the ramifications? </span></p>

						<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There were fireworks at the Patna regional headquarters of India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the morning of November 8. Early trends seemed to indicate that the BJP, the party backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would win the Bihar state-level elections hands down. But it was not to be. When the final results came in, it was the Grand Alliance — a group of often-warring parties — that walked away with the victory. The BJP functionaries took things in their stride. They even sold to the winners the stockpiles of firecrackers they had accumulated to celebrate a victory (the BJP is, after all, a party of small businessmen and traders) and disappeared into the woodwork.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But fresh fireworks were to follow. Four BJP “elders” issued a joint statement calling for a thorough review of the reasons for the Bihar debacle. Instead of development and economic reforms being the key issues, the debate was hijacked by Modi’s personality. His detractors on the outside saw the election loss as being a backlash against Hindu fundamentalist intolerance. Inside the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the BJP-led coalition Modi heads, the cause of the defeat was perceived to be arrogance and imperiousness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The four BJP veterans retired after Modi’s sweep in the general elections in 2014 were former deputy prime minister L.K. Advani, former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi, former finance minister Yashwant Sinha and former consumer affairs minister Shanta Kumar. “To say that everyone is responsible for the defeat in Bihar is to ensure that no one is held responsible,” said the statement signed by Sinha on behalf of the others. “The principal reason for the latest defeat is the way the party has been ‘emasculated’ in the last year.” (The “latest” defeat refers to the showing by the newly-formed Aam Aadmi Party, which captured the state of Delhi that the BJP was also supposed to win.)</span></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the criticism by the elders has taken the wind out of the opposition’s sails. They were planning to go aggressively at Modi during the coming winter session of Parliament. Instead, Modi’s own party has done it for them. Was this planned? It is singular that Modi visited Advani to “seek his blessings” a few days before the five-phase Bihar polls came to an end. The ostensible reason: It was the veteran’s 89</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> birthday. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Deals in the U.K.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The next day, according to the media, the BJP moved into damage-control mode. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had to fill in for Modi because the PM was globetrotting again, this time to visit the U.K. and to attend the G-20 meeting in Turkey. Deals worth $13.7 billion were signed during the U.K. trip. However, this pales in comparison to the $61.9 billion investment by China (including several billion for three nuclear power plants to be set up in the U.K.) announced during the visit of Chinese president Xi Jinping in October. Modi was welcomed by a 60,000-strong crowd of mainly ethnic Indians at Wembley Stadium in London. There were fireworks here, too — literally.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Parties in states that are likely to go to the polls in the near future may well take their cues from the Grand Alliance.”<span class="attribution">–Ravi Aron</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, party loyalists who took the acrimony at face value — not everybody believes that Modi and his lieutenant, party chief Amit Shah, are capable of devious thinking — dashed off their own letter. Union ministers and former party presidents Rajnath Singh, Venkaiah Naidu and Nitin Gadkari wrote, “The party won the Lok Sabha elections last year under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Thereafter, the party had success in the assembly elections of Jharkhand, Haryana, Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir. The results of Delhi and Bihar have been adverse…. The party would certainly welcome any guidance and suggestions from our seniors in this regard.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is not as though the BJP has become bogged down in this house cleaning to forget about its economic reforms initiative. “Bihar is a wake-up call for Modi,” says Baba Prasad, visiting professor of management at the Indian Institute of Information Technology in Hyderabad and a fellow at the <a target="_blank" href="http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/"><span class="s3">Wharton Financial Institutions Center</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two days after the Bihar results, Jaitley announced a spate of new reforms. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was to be made easier in 15 sectors including retail, defense, construction, banking and electronic media. The key difference is that portfolio investors can now take the automatic route instead of having to apply to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in each instance involving the crossing of a specified ceiling. Nirmala Sitharaman, minister of state for finance, explains that this process was always available on a case-by-case basis. What the government has done is to eliminate red tape. It is well known that once the bureaucracy gets into the picture, delays are inevitable. The relaxation in 15 sectors is in line with the Modi government’s promise to focus on the ease of doing business.</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everybody agrees that there have really been true reforms or that the initiatives are good for India. “I think what is being touted as reforms by the Modi government is questionable,” says Mirza Asmer Beg, professor of political science at the Aligarh Muslim University. “Most of what is being called reforms are primarily measures that facilitate investment from capitalists in the country and outside.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the believers kept their faith. Jaitley promised more reforms to follow. Modi, for his part, kept the flag flying at Wembley. “We want to balance the two FDIs: Foreign Direct Investment and First Develop India…. Whether it’s the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF), they all say India is the fastest-growing economy. All rating agencies show positive feedback on India’s economic growth.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strictly speaking, that’s not correct. Moody’s has just come out with a report warning that unless Modi steps in to control members of the BJP, India runs the risk of losing domestic and global credibility. The prime minister’s office dismissed it as the work of a junior analyst belonging to Moody’s Analytics and not that of Moody’s at all. But the organization is standing by the report. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Reaction of Foreign Investors</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But what is the general reaction of foreign investors and rating agencies? Fitch Ratings said that though the Bihar defeat will complicate politics, it is unlikely to have any impact on the government’s economic agenda. The IMF says the reforms in India are moving in the right direction.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“There has been no emphasis on reforms that actually benefit the Indian economy or the Indian people.”<span class="attribution">–Jayati Ghosh</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ravi Aron, professor at the Carey Business School at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, goes into the impact of the Bihar loss in greater detail. “There are three different categories of impact that need to be considered: policy regime; economic behavior of states; and the resulting imbalances in state-level economic outcomes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For the policy regime as it applies to policies that go against entrenched interests, the impact will be indirect,” Aron says. As examples of policies that threaten these interests, Aron cites the pending bills on a goods and services tax and land acquisition. These bills are stuck in the upper house where the ruling party lacks a majority and the Bihar loss will further diminish their share of Rajya Sabha votes. “Even if the NDA had won in Bihar, the ruling party and its allies would not have a majority in the upper house. So the incremental impact of this loss is not direct,” Aron notes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, he adds, the loss may not be insignificant. “The regional populists and parties representing some combination of feudal and caste interests might see two takeaways from this election: First, that economic reform is politically unpopular. Second, appealing to the power of entrenched sectarian and ethnic groups is a winning gambit if you can stitch together a coalition that has enough of an electoral mass,” Aron says.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Bihar results might change the way elections are fought in India. Coalitions are currently the order of the day. This has also been so in the past, but now the coalitions are composed of several parties of near-equal strength. “That is a good thing,” says Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Aron adds, “Parties in states that are likely to go to the polls in the near future — Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal — may well take their cues from the Grand Alliance.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Beg disagrees. “Such alliances are not easy,” he says. “Every state has different dynamics. In the Lok Sabha elections in which BJP got a thumping majority, it got around 30%-35% of the votes — that is their core vote base. If, from the rest, around 45% come together, then you cannot match that. So in Bihar, it wasn’t that the BJP performed badly, it was that the others got together and ensured they were defeated.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of the day, what were the issues, shorn of the rhetoric, all about? Prasad says, “It is a vote for development-driven politics. The Bihar people evaluated the BJP on the sluggish progress of economic reforms, which paled in comparison to what Nitish Kumar (the chief minister of Bihar) had achieved in his 10 years as CM (chief minister). <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.wharton.upenn.edu%2Farticle%2Fwill-a-loss-in-bihar-derail-the-modi-governments-economic-reforms%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknlg.net%2F1l38TqY&amp;source=tweetbutton&amp;text=%27The%20message%20from%20Bihar%20is%20that%20voters%20are%20looking%20for%20economic%20progress%20and%20not%20for%20traditional%20...%20politics.%27" class="fyc_printfriendly tweetthislink" target="_blank">The message from Bihar is that the voting public is looking for economic progress and not for traditional caste, religion or region based politics. <i class="ss-icon ss-social" style="font-size:10pt">Twitter</i> </a> The loosening up of FDI policies in 15 sectors is an indication of that.” The pace of reforms, he believes, will only become faster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Need for Political Bargains</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The government may need to strike political bargains with powerful regional parties to pass legislation or let the states determine their own policy regimes,” says Aron. “Crucial labor reforms, especially to the Industrial Disputes Act, will probably not happen. Infrastructure in some states will improve and attract value-added manufacturing.” But he adds that “the backwaters of India — the BIMARU (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) states, West Bengal and the geographically-remote northeast — will see very slow manufacturing growth. We are seeing growth in highly capital intensive manufacturing in India while labor-intensive manufacturing continues to languish.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Aron, “The trifecta of very poor infrastructure in the factors of production, in the logistics of delivery, and extremely inflexible labor laws, has resulted in very poor levels of job creation.” The electorate in India wants good, manufacturing jobs, but does not want reforms, he notes. “Many states will not support rationalizing labor laws, land acquisition for infrastructure and privatization of unprofitable enterprises. The result is that those states that improve their infrastructure (including education and public health) will continue to grow while others fall behind. This may well be India’s ‘two-state solution’ to the problem of economic growth.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The message from Bihar is that the voting public is looking for economic progress and not for traditional caste, religion or region based politics.”<span class="attribution">–Baba Prasad</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Ghosh notes that it is already evident that the government will continue to pursue reforms designed to attract foreign capital, like the easing of caps in various critical sectors including banking that was announced recently. “However, there has been no emphasis on reforms that actually benefit the Indian economy or the Indian people, and the PM does not show any indications that he has plans to regenerate growth other than waiting for private capital to come and invest, which is unlikely in the current scenario,” Ghosh says. “If the Bihar results force the central government to focus more on inclusive growth, that would help. But so far it is not clear that this will happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nor is Ghosh particularly enthused by Modi’s global successes in Silicon Valley or at Wembley. “The Modi government has actually worsened ties with neighboring countries in the recent past. The situation in Nepal has been greatly mishandled, relations with Pakistan must have deteriorated considerably after the incendiary and appalling statements made by Modi and Amit Shah during the Bihar campaign, there are serious concerns about links with Bangladesh,” he says. “Most of Modi’s external relations are directed at visiting countries where he was earlier denied a visa, and doing world tours focused on photo-ops with leaders and ego-tripping sessions with non-resident Indians. Very little genuine foreign policy work has been done.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One leading indicator has given mixed signals. In a knee-jerk reaction, the markets dropped 150 points plus the day after the results were announced. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex spent the rest of the week in the doghouse only to recover during Muhurat (the Indian new year) trading a few days later. “In our view, the market has been excessively focused on reforms,” says a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch report. “It is lending rate cuts that hold the key to cyclical recovery.” And, after a long time, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan seems to be amenable to doing so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">India has already underperformed the MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) Emerging Market index by 3%-4% over the past few weeks. The Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) BSE Sensex has plunged nearly 7% in the past year. The only direction for the markets — India is one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world — to go is up. Corporate earnings have been dismal recently. But bottom lines are expected to be brighter next year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The market belongs to the bulls. But political scientists tend to be more bearish. Says Ghosh: “Thus far, Modi has shown complete arrogance and intolerance of dissent.” Adds Beg: “Modi seems to be more concerned with issues that are peripheral as far the governance of a developing country like India is concerned. He appears to be prime minister of rich India and of the diaspora. There doesn’t seem to be anything in the economic reforms to benefit the common man and poor people.”</span></p>

						<p><em>The world’s economic system has been through a lot in recent years — from the challenge of the financial crisis to income inequality, the pressures of immigration, changing technologies and geographic shifts in production, to name a few. In this opinion piece, Kalin Anev Janse, secretary general and a member of the management board of the European Stability Mechanism (the eurozone’s lender of last resort), considers five major challenges and why international organizations offer the best hope for managing them.</em></p>
<p>A year ago, we were shaken by geopolitical shifts with unpredictable ripple effects. The situation looks no more stable today. The Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential election outcome signal dramatic changes in cooperation globally and a push for more protectionism. In practice, these votes called into question the multilateral institutions and international collaboration among countries that embody that cooperation. In autumn 2017, we gathered together a group of senior officials from the 13 largest international organizations to try to crack these problems.</p>

<p>Exactly 10 years ago, in 2007, the first signs of the Great Recession emerged. By 2008, the U.S.-led subprime crisis evolved into a global financial crisis. By 2010, Europe had become engulfed in its own crisis, throwing financial markets into turmoil and several sovereigns into a downward spiral of debt and banking crises.</p>
<p>Despite the current ongoing recovery, and the successful economic rebound both in North America and Europe, worrying trends became apparent in 2016. Some major players demonstrated a reduced commitment to multilateral cooperation, criticism of open and free trade, and fading interest in climate change. This new landscape increased uncertainty and poses a threat to more buoyant macroeconomic and financial fundamentals. It also puts a strain on relations between major players internationally, as well as between citizens domestically. In countries like the U.S. and the UK, it abruptly split societies in half and threatened a reverse of seven decades of international cooperation.</p>
<p>All these elements are putting pressure on international organizations as well. International organizations are increasingly called upon to redefine their role to ensure that their programs and activities are still relevant in this evolving political and macroeconomic landscape. They are also pushed to show how they add value to citizens’ lives. At the same time, they need to maintain lean structures to minimize the burden on taxpayers, and enhance efficiency and effectiveness of their activities. So, what has changed?</p>
<p><strong>Five Major Shifts that Rocked Our World</strong></p>
<p>There are five trend shifts globally that by their nature call for international cooperation, but they have been underestimated, undervalued and under-addressed both nationally and internationally. The results shook our world with an unforeseeable force.</p>
<p><strong>1. Growing Income Inequality  </strong></p>
<p>People have an age-old tendency to compare themselves to their neighbors, especially when it comes to wealth. We are less concerned about our absolute level of wealth, but look more at what we have and own in relative terms to the people around us. Global private wealth reached a record $166.5 trillion in 2016, an increase of 5.3% over the previous year, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).<sup>1</sup> In 2015, the increase was 4.4%. Faster economic growth and stock price performance mainly drove the rapid increase.</p>
<p>But this growth is not spread equally. Private wealth in Asia-Pacific is likely to surpass that of Western Europe by as early as the end of this year, BCG’s analysis shows. This could be an economic shock for many citizens of traditional western powerhouses. Such changes need to be watched and managed carefully as they tilt economic and political power. British geographer and politician Sir Halford Mackinder used to say: “Unequal growth among nations tends to produce a hegemonic world war about every 100 years.” We can only hope he is wrong.</p>
<blockquote><p> “Just eight men now own the same wealth as 3.6 billion people globally, more than half of humanity….”</p></blockquote>
<p>Inequality is getting ever worse. A tipping point was reached in 2015, when the richest 1% in the world owned as much as the rest of humanity. This trend has continued and further accelerated. Just eight men now own the same wealth as 3.6 billion<u> </u>people globally, more than half of humanity, according to a January 2017 Oxfam report. Income inequality is on the rise as the affluent continue to accumulate wealth, often at the expense of the poorer.</p>
<p>Richard Reeves points out in his book <em>Dream Hoarders</em>, that we shouldn’t only be worried about the top 1% or 0.01%. More importantly, in some countries, like the U.S., there is a widening gap in society between the upper middle class and everyone else. (Reeves defines the upper middle class as those whose incomes are in the top 20% of U.S. society.) These growing disparities are reflected in family structure, neighborhoods, attitudes and lifestyle. The top income earners are becoming more effective at passing on their status to their children, thus reducing overall social mobility and increasing social divisions, along class as well as income lines.</p>
<p>And all this has an interesting twist: the inequality paradox. Despite the progress in reducing global poverty and reduction of inequality among countries since 1980s, income inequality <em>within</em> countries has been rising. These days, almost one-third of global inequality is attributable to in-country inequality (figure 1), making clear why many voters across the western world feel as they do.</p>

<p>How disruptive will the effect of globalization and technological advances be on labor markets? That is a key question today. Over the last three decades, advanced economies have seen labor-intensive sector jobs move to emerging markets. In other cases, new technologies have made certain occupations obsolete. UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) released a policy brief last year that said robots could take away two-thirds of jobs in developing countries.</p>
<p>We see some of these shifts already. Today’s five largest global companies are: Apple, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. They employ around 720,000 people. A decade ago, the big five were completely different: Petrochina, Exxon Mobile, General Electric, China Mobile, and Bank of China. They employed around 1.3 million people. What a decade can do! Today’s five biggest companies are all technology companies. Their market capitalization is 30% higher than that of the top five a decade ago; they achieve that with a whopping 44% less staff (figure 2). This has a large impact on labor markets and jobs.</p>
<p><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-103470 aligncenter" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-2-997x1024.jpg" alt="figure-2" width="610" height="627" srcset="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-2-997x1024.jpg 997w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-2-292x300.jpg 292w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-2-768x789.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"></a></p>
<p>Does this alter work preferences? Yes, and this is best assessed by looking at the two most dynamic groups of (future) job seekers: millennials and today’s teenagers. They feel that they are receiving conflicting messages from employers and career advisors: On the one hand, they are told that robots are bound to replace future jobs; on the other, they need technical skills to compete in the job market.</p>
<p>Caught in this conundrum, they are trying to create new types of jobs, rather than going for traditional ones such as banking, finance, or accounting. They dream of becoming YouTube stars, famous videogame vloggers, or Instagram travel bloggers who are paid by sponsors to visit hotels and restaurants around the world and generate sufficient number of likes. New creative companies pop up even in professions that well-educated young people ignored for many decades. Old merchants’ jobs have been revived, from organic bakers to cool rural wine-makers and hipster butchers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Forty-five percent of the global working age population is underutilized, either unemployed or underemployed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I am less concerned about the imaginative young generation; they will find their way. It is the group of middle-to-older, middle-to-lower-skilled workers where issues might arise. A recent McKinsey estimate shows that 45% of the global working age population is underutilized, either unemployed or underemployed. Unless there is a redirection of investment into labor-intensive productive sectors and retraining, the desired job creation may not happen, fueling unhappiness, unrest and populism.</p>
<p><strong>3. Rising Protectionism</strong></p>
<p>G20 countries have become more protectionist. The total number of discriminatory protectionist measures implemented by G20 countries has increased over the past five years (figure 3). The main driver has been the U.S. According to the Global Trade Alert report, had the United States been excluded, the total number of protectionist policy instruments imposed by the G20 would have been lower in 2017 than in 2016. The U.S. has implemented the most protectionist and trade restrictive measures of its peer group, the European Union the least (figure 4). This sounds counter-intuitive for the country that prides itself as an open economy, but it seems that it is Europe that is championing trade barrier reductions and the avoidance of protectionist measures.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The recent refugee crisis in Syria and the resulting arrival of more than one million migrants in 2015-2016 in Germany presented a formidable challenge to political and social stability.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Increasing Migration</strong></p>
<p>The recent refugee crisis in Syria and the resulting arrival of more than one million migrants in 2015-2016 in Germany presented a formidable challenge to political and social stability. In addition to tougher checks on the EU’s external borders, and a controversial refugee pact with Turkey, the EU is investing more in the migrants’ countries of origin. The refugees from Syria have been fleeing a brutal civil war. They are escaping violence, as many also are from Iraq and Afghanistan, and, in such cases, humanitarian reasons should always prevail over other considerations. Wars, climate change, and broader economic and social inequalities are the root causes of migration flows. While these increases in migration are all easy to understand, they nonetheless cause issues in the countries of arrival: integration problems, absorption limits and skills-mismatches.</p>

<p><strong>5. Growing Influence of Social Media and the Post-truth World</strong></p>
<p>Social media pose the final major challenge to international organizations. According to a recent analysis by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, 51% of people with online access use social media as a news source. Social media is the primary source for news for 44% of smartphone users in the U.S. and 38% in the U.K. (figure 7). Coupled with the proliferation of so-called fake news, which became so prominent in last year’s U.S. elections, as well as social media’s favoring of ever shorter and catchier messages, it is no wonder that many observers are saying we are living in a post-truth world.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the November 2016 U.S. elections … top fake election news stories generated more total engagement on Facebook than the top election stories from the 19 major news outlets combined.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent BuzzFeed analysis of social media traffic in the run-up to the November 2016 U.S. elections found that top fake election news stories generated more total engagement on Facebook than the top election stories from the 19 major news outlets combined (figure 8). These trends represent serious tests on many fronts, including combating terrorism and securing the proper functioning of democratic institutions. Fear, anger and despair enlist recruits for terrorism. They also create a more polarized social climate and the rise of extremism, as we were recently reminded by the tragic events in Charlottesville in the U.S. or by some half a dozen car terror attacks in Europe this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-8.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-103476 aligncenter" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-8-1024x752.jpg" alt="figure-8" width="610" height="448" srcset="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-8-1024x752.jpg 1024w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-8-300x220.jpg 300w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-8-768x564.jpg 768w, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-8.jpg 1556w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Is Peaceful International Collaboration Ending? </strong></p>
<p>Despite these daunting challenges, there are also reasons to be optimistic. At the European level, political leaders have regained faith in sticking together to address global and societal realities. At least two factors have been crucial to the recovery of confidence in the European project. First, the EU is delivering economically. The euro area and the broader EU recently recorded their highest ever employment levels. Investment is up, and growth is projected to be on a par with, if not higher than, growth in the U.S. this year.</p>
<p>Second, despite growing populism, Europe’s citizens have confidently stood for democracy, open borders, economic reforms, and more Europe. The results of the elections in the Netherlands and France bore witness to this positive trend among European societies. In spite of the recent electoral gains of an extreme right-wing party in Germany, the election outcome was again clearly pro-European. The continent appears in better shape today than it did after Brexit one year ago.</p>
<p>In my view, Europe can offer lessons in regional integration that are relevant for other parts of the world. Among others, my institution – the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – is a product of European cooperation in response to the financial and economic crisis. As the largest and most active regional financing arrangement, the ESM works closely with its peers in other regions of the world.</p>
<p>Beyond Europe, the continued rise of Asian economies, as well as those in Latin America, present new opportunities for strengthening international cooperation in many of the areas I have mentioned, including finance, infrastructure, energy, education, climate change and others.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean for public international organizations? These organizations act as agents of their shareholders (i.e., member states) and are called upon to help address difficult challenges. Some international organizations that raise funds in the capital markets for their operations, like mine, also have to be attuned to the concerns of their investors. In general, international organizations also dispose of soft power, derived from funds and moral suasion based on extensive experience, as well as the values and norms that they adhere to and champion. Obviously, international organizations also need a broad-based buy-in from the public at large, in particular in times of change and uncertainty. All this needs to be done while maintaining lean organizational structures to keep the costs for taxpayers low.</p>
<p>In our autumn 2017 session of the group of senior officials from international organizations, we pushed ourselves to find modern ways to explain better what we do and what we can offer when it comes to tackling these challenges. Among other matters, we discussed using more social media and empowering our talented and hard-working staff to share their personal stories, because it can best demonstrate the tremendous impact of their work.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Multilateral institutions and international organizations have proven to be the most effective way to solve complex global problems in a peaceful and constructive way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We also need to make our institutions less bureaucratic and truly “lean, clean and green,” not only because it is more efficient but also because it can help us attract more talent among the millennial generation. And finally, we need to work even harder to better cooperate with each other and to ensure the missions and activities of our institutions make a difference, because nothing can demonstrate the value of multilateralism better than international organizations delivering effective and sustainable solutions to the most pressing global challenges.</p>
<p>But at the end there is only one question that matters: Is there any alternative way to making our world with more than 7 billion people work? Not at this stage – multilateral institutions and international organizations have proven to be the most effective way to solve complex global problems in a peaceful and constructive way. All other alternatives involve far more violence, aggression and isolation. If we look through the eyes of our children, it is much wiser to collaborate and work together rather than fight (digitally) with our global neighbors, whether close by or far away.</p>

						<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3803" title="Manmohan Singh" src="http://d29rnz06qthrny.cloudfront.net/today/files/2012/06/Manmohan-Singh.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="160">In 1991, when the Indian economy was on its last legs and the country was on the verge of defaulting on its international obligations, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh ushered in an era of economic reforms. They worked: India became one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world.</p>
<p>But history is now repeating itself. India’s rating has been downgraded by S&amp;P and Fitch. And a duo including Finance Minister Manmohan Singh is heading the rescue act. Of course, things are not exactly the same. Singh is prime minister too, having taken additional charge when erstwhile Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee stepped down to run for president. (The presidential elections are on July 19 but, as a candidate for the ruling party with outside support, Mukherjee is near certain to win.)</p>
<p>This time around, Singh’s companion in action is the ruling Congress Party chief Sonia Gandhi and she is expected to want approval on every policy change. On June 27, shortly after taking over as PM, Singh called upon the country to shed the current climate of pessimism. “Revive the animal spirits in the country’s economy,” Singh told finance ministry officials. (Singh, an economist, was talking in a Keynesian sense of consumer confidence.)</p>
<p>Singh further spelled out the problems facing India. “At the current juncture, we are passing through challenging times economically,” he said. “The growth rate has taken a dip, industrial performance is not satisfactory, things are not rosy on the investment front [and] inflation continues to be a problem…. On the external front, I am concerned about the way the exchange rate is going. Investor sentiment is down and capital flows are drying up.”</p>
<p>There seemed to be acceptance of the fact that mistakes have been made. Former Finance Minister Mukherjee, on his last visit to his office, told the media: “I know that not every decision I have taken might have been right. But I have taken those decisions always keeping in mind the simple and poor people I knew from my childhood.” That is the nearest a politician can get to admit giving in to populist inclinations.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mukherjee’s biggest errors, his critics say, have been in the last Union Budget. He reversed a Supreme Court decision in a <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4677">tax case against Vodafone</a>. Retrospective taxes added to the scare. “There are problems on the tax front, which need to be addressed,” noted Singh. Much must be done “to restart the India growth story,” he added.</p>
<p>Getting Mukherjee out of the way was the first step, observers note. He has repeatedly defended his tax proposals, and suggestions that he move to another ministry with former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram taking over were not welcomed, as this would have been seen as a demotion. Mukherjee has been through this before. In 1984, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated, he threw his hat into the ring to become prime minister. But the party instead chose Rajiv Gandhi, a pilot for a commercial airline, to become prime minister. And Mukherjee spent many years in the cold. This time the President’s job can be projected as a promotion, though the role is entirely ornamental. (In India, it’s a job equivalent to that of the Queen of England.)</p>
<p>Will Singh be able to usher in reform a second time? Among the potential roadblocks are that some loyalists of the Gandhi family would like to see him fail, as success would take part of the aura away from Sonia Gandhi and heir apparent, Rahul Gandhi. A successful Singh may start commanding a political base of its own. Besides, the real issue is building up confidence in foreign investors and Indian businessmen. After the shocks they have had from the budget and other measures, that may not be too easy a task. The stock market, the principal leading indicator, has been ambivalent. They prefer to wait and watch.</p>

Much of that discussion centered on the ethics of such a move. But Pauly, an economist, suggests a different framework for analyzing the issue. His comments, below, appeared earlier this week in a new blog — Voices@LDI — started by Penn’s <a target="_blank" href="http://ldi.upenn.edu/about">Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics</a>.</i></p>
<p>The recent debate about the ethics of a health system’s decision to refuse to hire new workers who smoke was understandably couched in the framework of ethics. But hiring a worker — buying labor — is an economic transaction that occurs in a market, and so it may be useful to discuss the economic framework as well.</p>
<p>The very narrow framework presented was of a firm (a hospital, in this case) hiring a given number of workers in a labor market where more workers are willing to work at the wage-benefit package it offers than it needs to hire. Thus the ethical issue is framed as whether it is fair to “give” one of the jobs in short supply to a non-smoker rather than a smoker. But wages and demand for labor are determined in markets, both for labor and for products or services. Considering these market level effects, I argue that that some of the framing of the ethical problem is factually dubious and that the conclusions about fairness may need to be modified.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><b>Wages, Jobs, Discrimination</b></p>
<p>In general labor economics, there are two well-known predictions: 1) the total compensation paid to a given worker in a given job will equal the marginal revenue the firm expects to bring in because it hired the worker, and 2) at that level of total compensation, labor markets will “clear” (all workers who want to work at that level of compensation will find employment and employers will not be looking to alter either employment or total compensation). How might smoking affect the equilibrium of total compensation, money wages, and employment levels in a competitive labor markets?</p>
<p>Smokers are less productive. The empirical evidence that smokers have lower productivity over working years is fairly strong. They are less productive because they may miss work more frequently (absenteeism) and because their smoking-related health conditions (shortness of breath, cardiovascular conditions) may affect their ability to perform certain kinds of jobs (presenteeism). Even if the firm does not pay sick leave, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17628862">disruptive effects of more frequent absences</a> in jobs that require teamwork (such as hospital nursing) will probably lead initially to costs on employers. These cost effects may be minimized if wages can be varied for a given job, or, if wages cannot be varied, by hiring non-smokers.</p>
<p>Smokers have higher medical costs. Smokers have higher average health care costs than non-smokers, other things being equal. (They may have higher life insurance costs but lower pension costs, as well.) Almost all job-related insurance in hospitals is experience-rated or self-insured. Even if employee premiums for health and life insurance are not adjusted for smoking status and wages are uniform within firms, the fact that medical costs will increase for firms or occupations with larger shares of smokers means that there will be offsetting reductions in money wages.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Consumers and coworkers may prefer non-smokers. In face-to-face interaction with workers, buyers may have preferences about behaviors or appearance of workers; attributes that buyers regard as negative will depress total compensation and wages. In contrast, for occupations and industries where consumers see only the final product (a manufactured good, a piloted airplane) there should be no such discriminatory effects. However, if co-workers have similar preferences, they may require higher money wages to work with smokers.</p>
<p><b>Labor Outcomes at the Firm and Market Levels</b></p>
<p>The effects of smoking are easier to predict at the level of overall labor markets. Suppose that, across local labor markets, smoking rates vary for workers in a particular occupation or industry. The prediction is that smoking will lower average total compensation in those markets with larger proportions of smokers; whether compensation packages within markets are lower for smokers specifically or for all workers in high-smoking communities or occupations depends in part on what is administratively feasible and/or legal. If wage/premium discrimination is not possible, the compensation of all workers will be depressed, but aggregate data across markets will show lower total wages and compensation for smokers since they are more likely to be present in high-smoking markets. Higher benefits costs for smokers will further depress money wages unless employee-paid premiums can fully reflect higher benefits costs. Either way, take home pay will be lower in such markets.</p>
<p>If all firms in a market hire from the same labor pool with its mix of smokers and non-smokers, these effects will be uniform across firms. However, individual firms may  correctly estimate that, if they increase money wages above the prevailing level but then only hire non-smokers from the pool of applicants, the firm  may lower total labor cost. Note that behaving in such a discriminatory  fashion has a cost to the firm that follows this policy — it pays higher total compensation or hires less qualified workers — but its bottom line may still be better off.</p>
<p>This was one of Milton Friedman’s most perceptive arguments about discrimination, whether racial or habit-related: Whatever it does to workers, it costs employers money to discriminate. If all or most firms in a local market decide to discriminate, either money wages of smokers will fall (if wages can be discriminatory), or there will be an increase in unemployment among smokers if wage and/or insurance premium discrimination is not possible.</p>
<p><b>Ethical Arguments</b></p>
<p>Now, about those ethical arguments over not hiring smokers…</p>
<p>As an economist, I have no expertise in ethical judgments, but I can discuss how this economic framework might interact with the ethical arguments on both sides.</p>
<ul>
<li>The employer who discriminates against smokers pays a price for doing so compared to not doing it — just what Friedman said about racial discrimination. The employer may offset a benefit it expects to get against this price, but it is making a sacrifice; discrimination is not free, and the worse it is, the more it costs the discriminator.</li>
<li>If all employers of a particular kind of labor (e.g., all hospitals) discriminate in a particular way against smokers, their wages are likely to fall. This means that, despite the point in the previous paragraph, employers may paradoxically, after the dust clears, end up paying little or no cost, though each employer would still lower its labor costs if it stopped discriminating. It all depends on alternative jobs available to smoking workers and      whether those jobs discriminate.</li>
<li>Any effects on health insurance costs can be handled with higher premiums for smokers — so that, if such smoker surcharges are in place, higher medical costs are no longer a reason to refuse to hire smokers; they pay their own way.</li>
<li>Discrimination for reasons other than medical costs will cut smoking workers’ job opportunities to a greater extent if wages cannot be varied by smoking status. If wages can be varied, jobs will still be there (although at lower wages, smokers may not want them) but both incentives to stop smoking and compensation to the employer for any distress to consumers will occur. The effect need not be large if smokers seek jobs in other industries, but it can happen.</li>
<li>The public health argument for discrimination is that increasing the cost to workers of smoking — you won’t be able to get a good job in our firm or industry — may cause workers to stop smoking or never start. This societal benefit should be offset against perceptions of ethical unfairness. Maybe, but this is a slippery slope. Think of other behaviors that society would like to discourage, such as teenage pregnancy or committing a felony. Should good jobs be closed to young mothers and felons who served their time? There is probably some calculus that can rationalize discrimination here, but it is distinctly unlovely — and there must be better and more effective ways to change behavior than this. Even without accepting the argument that there are kinder and better ways to get people to stop smoking, the “no job for you smokers” strategy seems like (pardon the expression) overkill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the argument that discrimination is unethical because it penalizes smokers for an involuntary addiction also suffers by extension, because taxes on cigarettes do the same thing, and few would think that taxing smoking or drinking (alcoholic or sugar-sweetened) beverages is unethical because it discriminates against addicts. Plus, the incontrovertible fact that this addictive behavior responds to prices shows that it is not perfectly addictive — so do we need to decide how much is addiction and how much something else?</p>
<p>The most fundamental message is one you might expect from an economist: Whatever your ethical goals, it is better to achieve them by adjusting wages and prices than by rules about who gets a job. Using financial rewards and penalties can change behavior at least as effectively as discrimination, without adding excess harm to workers who cannot kick the habit. Like carbon taxes, these penalties may not seem to some to be sufficient punishment of the guilty or statement of virtuous behavior by the employer — if you are allowed to sin if you pay the price, aren’t we being nonserious about sin and letting sinners off too easily? But overall, these strategies may be better in the sense of being fairer and more effective at discouraging behavior whose costs outweigh its benefits.</p>

<p>After a year of solid gains, the economic recovery is beginning to slow. Demand is trailing off as inventory levels have been restored and emergency stimulus measures withdrawn. Continued high unemployment and a downtick in housing are weighing on consumer confidence and spending. Add unexpected shocks from Europe and a slowdown in China, and forecasters are now ratcheting down their expectations for growth over the next year.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve recently concluded that the “economic outlook had softened somewhat” and now predicts that the economy will grow between 3% and 3.5% this year, down from its prior forecast of 3.2% to 3.7%. Financial services firm JP Morgan on July 16 reduced its forecast for U.S. GDP growth this year by a percentage point to 2.6%. “The loss of global growth momentum at the end of the second quarter is greater than we had anticipated,” according to the firm’s global data watch report. </p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>“We’ve definitely hit a soft patch,” says Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel.cfm"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a>. “It looks like a temporary pause in the recovery, but my feeling is that the chance of a double-dip is extremely low.”</p>
<p>According to Siegel, a slowdown at this point in the recovery is to be expected. In a typical recession, inventory levels fall, then ramp up sharply to meet pent-up demand in the early phases of the recovery. This recovery appears to have begun last summer and was gaining steam in the first half of the year as inventories were replenished. Now, production is leveling off as inventories reach normal levels, softening overall growth. At the same time, Siegel adds, government stimulus programs designed to jump-start the economy, such as cash-for-clunkers and incentives for first-time homeowners, have now ended.</p>
<p>Unemployment, which remains near 10%, continues to be a significant drag on the economy. “The issue at the moment is that the unemployment number will be lousy for a long time,” says Wharton management professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/cappelli.cfm"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/cappelli/" target="_blank">Peter Cappelli</a>. (See accompanying video interview with Cappelli on this page.) He notes that even as hiring expands, unemployment will increase. That’s because unemployment figures only measure people actively seeking work. As hiring improves, more people who have given up searching for work will begin filing applications for jobs and will be counted as unemployed, driving the number up and consumer confidence down.</p>
<p><strong>A ‘Credit Recession’</strong></p>
<p>Cappelli cautions that it is difficult to compare the current recovery to those that occurred after other recessions. Most recessions are caused by a build up of inventory or production capacity in the economy that must be worked off over time. In contrast, says Cappelli, “this was a credit recession. Bang. All of a sudden, [credit] disappeared. How it comes back — I don’t think we have a clear guideline.”</p>
<p>He points to housing as a key to recovery. While U.S. mortgage rates are low, Cappelli says it is difficult for many people to get approval for a mortgage. “That’s what’s holding back the economic recovery. The big thing to watch for, because it is such a big chunk of the economy, is housing.” More than one million American households face foreclosure this year, on top of 900,000 who lost their homes in 2009, according to RealtyTrac, which adds that in a typical year, 100,000 foreclosures take place. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reports that housing starts were down 5% in June. </p>
<p>“The housing market is going nowhere,” according to Wharton professor of real estate and finance <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/wachter.cfm">Susan Wachter</a>. However, she points out that housing prices are no longer spiraling down and are not likely to trigger a double-dip recession. She predicts that prices will be flat for 2010, but that it will take years to work off the current oversupply of homes — including those that are not officially on the market but are “underwater,” leaving homeowners trapped in their properties. “What we’re in for is a slog — a very long recovery.” </p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>Housing and employment have strong effects on consumer spending, which makes up 70% of the U.S. economy and is another closely watched gauge of recovery. Here, too, trends have turned downward in recent weeks. U.S. retail sales in June dropped for the second consecutive month, falling 0.5% from May. The latest Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell from 76 to 66.5 — a sharp decline after the index hit its highest level in 2.5 years a month earlier.</p>
<p>For example, Wharton management professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/macduffj.cfm"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/macduffie/" target="_blank">John Paul MacDuffie</a> points to auto sales, which had dropped to between nine million and 10 million units a year, down from 15 million at its peak in 2007. He says the normal replacement rate is 13 million, so that while consumers have put off buying new cars, ultimately they will have to replace rundown vehicles, leading to a bump in sales and production that should boost the recovery. “Auto sales are coming back, but I did notice in June there seemed to be a break in the curve of recovery,” MacDuffie notes. “The only explanation [I can see] is simply higher insecurity. People are worried.”</p>
<p><strong>Trouble in Europe and China</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the U.S., Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/allenf.cfm"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/allenf/" target="_blank">Franklin Allen</a> points to the debt crisis in Europe as another problem that is testing the economy’s ability to recover. As European countries adopt harsh budget cuts to reduce debt, employees will be laid off, leading to falling consumer demand which will hurt the global recovery. The cuts that have been announced seem to have calmed markets for the time being, he adds, but it remains to be seen if countries will be able to enact the harsh austerity programs that come with massive layoffs. If countries don’t go through with it, Allen predicts, the volatility that plagued financial markets in early summer will return. He notes that the upcoming results of European bank stress tests are another key to reassuring European markets. However, he says, “My guess is [these tests] will be a whitewash” and there might be a backlash “when people realize the stress tests are not really serious.”</p>
<p>At the same time, China can no longer be counted on to provide as much lift to the global economy as it had during the early part of the recovery, says Wharton management professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/meyer.cfm">Marshall Meyer</a>. He says China’s economy will slow this year from a 10% growth rate to 7% or 8%. As a result, global demand will decline. However, Meyer notes that over time, the Chinese government’s decision to slow growth and encourage more consumption throughout rural China will be good for the global economy, because it will lead to more long-term political stability and continued economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>All Eyes on Washington</strong></p>
<p>As economic conditions grow weaker, renewed attention is turning toward Washington. However, policy makers have fewer options because they are bogged down with debt — which is becoming a critical issue in the mid-term elections this fall. Final passage of a new financial reform package has removed some uncertainty in the financial sector. “It’s a good bill,” says Allen, but he adds that the legislation fails to address some of the major problems that led to the economic collapse and that it has no international oversight. “It will be fairly limited in practice.”</p>
<p>According to Wharton professor of business and public policy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/packh.cfm"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/packh/" target="_blank">Howard Pack</a>, GDP is not likely to expand further without renewed government stimulus. However, he argues that the Obama Administration used too much of its political capital to pass health care legislation through Congress. Consequently, it will have trouble getting new economic programs enacted in the face of claims that the government deficit is out of control and will damage the economy further in the future.</p>
<p>“I don’t think [the deficit] is a problem, but there are people in the business community who think the deficit will lead to a decrease in confidence and an increase in interest rates.” </p>
<p>Pack says that at a minimum, Congress should extend unemployment benefits and provide aid to state and local governments. (This week, Congress is expected to vote on an additional extension of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who remain out of work.) Both are efficient ways to pump money back into the economy, where it can multiply quickly as individuals spend their paychecks. Stimulus projects that are directed toward infrastructure development can take two to three years to work because of the time needed to develop plans, secure permits and initiate construction, he points out.</p>
<p>Pack, like Cappelli, says this recovery is trickier than others because of its root cause in the financial collapse. Recessions are sometimes triggered by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which raises interest rates when the economy starts to overheat and head toward inflation. This time, however, the recession was brought about by over-leverage throughout the financial sector. “Until the financial stuff is cleared up, we won’t be out of recession,” says Pack. “It’s very different than other recessions — much deeper and much more profound.”</p>
<p>Mark Zandi, chief economist and co-founder of Moody’s Economy.com, says there is good reason to be concerned about the deficit, but he says it will not be possible to address the nation’s fiscal problems until the economy is well on its way to recovery. “If we backslide into recession, the fiscal problems will balloon many times over,” he predicts. He, too, argues that the extension of unemployment benefits and expanding aid to state and local government are worthwhile expenditures. The deficit must be cut, he says. After the economy has recovered, the government should lay out a long-term plan to reduce spending over the next decade or so. According to Zandi, a credible plan would reassure investors and keep interest rates from soaring.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/smetters.cfm"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/smetters/" target="_blank">Kent Smetters</a>, Wharton professor of insurance and risk management, says the government has little capacity to expand stimulus programs because of the size of the current deficit and future obligations to pay for entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. “I’m cautious, if not pessimistic, because there is so much government debt, and the government doesn’t have the capacity to spend its way out of this. I see fairly anemic growth for a good five years, not a quick recovery.”</p>
<p>In addition to constraints on fiscal policy, Smetters notes that interest rates are at historical lows, and the Federal Reserve has little power to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy further, although one approach might be a tax policy that rewards new investment. Unlike reducing capital gains taxes, which relate to investment that has already been made, expensing for investment would generate new spending that could stimulate growth. “It is pretty costly,” Smetters acknowledges, “but if you’re going to have a big deficit, let’s at least have good reasons for it.”</p>
<p>Smetters adds that another problem standing in the way of recovery is a lack of leadership in Washington that can overcome political polarization and initiate effective economic policy. Zandi is also concerned about the attitude in Washington, particularly heading into the mid-term elections in November. “Economic policies have gotten completely wrapped up in the political debate, and that could lead to a serious mistake.” He says politicians are afraid to initiate new stimulus programs because of popular concerns about the budget deficit and fears that taxes will have to increase. The same thing happened in the early days of the crisis, he notes, when political posturing going into the 2008 elections delayed passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which only “exacerbated what was going on.”</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for Optimism</strong></p>
<p>Zandi has increased his odds of a double-dip recession — from one-in-five to one-in-four. However, his forecasts for 2011 and 2012 are more upbeat. He predicts real GDP will rise 4% in 2011 and 5% in 2012.</p>
<p>“The most fundamental reason for optimism is strong corporate earnings,” he says. Second quarter earnings are not as strong as the prior two quarters, but even though there are concerns about disappointing revenues, profits continue to remain strong and many companies are sitting on loads of cash. With these resources on hand, companies will have the ability to launch new initiatives and begin hiring again. Small businesses, he adds, continue to struggle, but large and mid-sized firms should be able to drive new expansion in the next six to 12 months.</p>
<p>Siegel, too, is optimistic about the recovery going forward. “I think what we are going to see is a pick up in consumer spending, a pick up in exports, and [we will] finally begin a recovery in the housing market which is so terribly depressed.” He adds that normal household formation will eventually lead to demand for housing. “The stock market will improve. The headlines from Europe are less ominous, and people will see that we’re not slipping into another recession.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Inflation has begun to accelerate at a significant pace in Latin America, much like it has in the United States and Europe. The main reasons for the inflationary spiral are today’s higher global prices for crude oil and such agricultural commodities as corn and wheat. The price of crude oil has risen 90% over the past year, reaching a peak of above $147 a barrel in July. Corn has doubled over the past 12 months.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dominique Strauss-Kahn, director general of the International Monetary Fund, warned on July 7 that inflation is a big problem in some parts of Latin America. “In some emerging countries and others with low income, inflation is getting out of control. This means that monetary policy probably needs to be adjusted,” Strauss-Kahn told a group of reporters in Toyako, Japan, Japan during the summit of the G-8 industrialized nations. Strauss-Kahn did not specify exactly which countries, but she indicated that she was talking about Latin America and Africa. Strauss-Kahn warned the leaders of the G-8 nations that although “growth is an important question, inflation is probably the greatest threat for the economy today.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Expectations for inflation are consistently getting higher,” notes David Alfredo Tuesta Cardenas, professor at the Pontifical Catholic University in Peru. “In those countries where central banks produce and publish surveys, you can see an upward movement of between 0.5 and 1 percentage point over the short term, and between 0.3 and 0.5 points in the projections for inflation over the next two or three years.” The cause for that, he says, “is basically the strong impact that higher prices for food and fuels are having [on prices].”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Country-by-Country Inflation</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You can see that in every country in the region. In Chile, short- and medium term expectations for inflation suffered a significant upward revision, according to the latest survey on economic expectations by the country’s central bank. In June, expectations for the end of the year rose to an annual rate of 7.5%, compared with projections of 5.5% made the previous month. Moreover, forecasts for the next one and two years are also worsening to 5.5% and 3.8% respectively (up from 4.5% and 3.5% in the previous survey.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Day by day, inflation is becoming more of a nightmare for the Argentine economy,” said Altina Sebastián González, professor of finance at the Complutense University in Madrid. The Consumer Price Index for May reached a year-to-year rate of 9.1%, “a percentage that underestimates real inflation for most Argentines.” In addition to external causes noted above, adds Sebastián, “are some underlying internal causes associated mainly with the growth in domestic spending at annual rates of about 9%, which far exceed the potential growth rate of the GDP, which is about 3.1% to 3.4% a year, according to my estimates.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sergio R. Torassa, professor of finance at the Pompeu Fabra University, explains that “the government headed by Mrs. Kirchner is carrying out an economic policy that attempts to shield the population from the effects of rising international prices. As a result, it has implemented a range of measures. These include targeted subsidies toward different sectors of the food chain such as the milk and poultry industry) mechanisms for tax deductions – which until this week incorporated variable deductions for soy, sunflower, corn and wheat and which have led to great conflict in the agricultural sector; and the prohibition and reduction of export quotas (for mutton, fuels, wheat), which provide preferences to local suppliers.” Nevertheless, Torassa believes that “these measures aren’t working, as you can see from the fact that inflation for foods and drinks is practically as high as the overall inflation level. Nevertheless, when you look at the underlying inflation rate, it winds up being higher, which suggests that the higher rate of inflation is tied to domestic factors.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Along the same lines, Hugo A. Macías Cardona, professor at the University of Medellín in Colombia, notes that “the mechanisms used for controlling inflation are not working; we are facing an exhaustion of the scheme for dealing with ‘objective inflation,’ which was first applied to Latin American monetary policy after they solved the problem of hyperinflation.” Macias explains that with this approach to objective inflation, officials “attempted to coordinate macroeconomic policy so they could avoid having inflation rates jump up whenever the economies [of the region] started to pursue a new path toward growth.” However, he believes that monetary policy “has become an impediment to growth, and a source of instability and disagreement.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The CPI in Brazil increased in May to a 5.6% annual rate, according to official government data. This confirmed the upward trend that began in June 2007. The underlying reasons, according to Sebastián, were “very strong domestic demand, accompanied by increased prices for energy in agricultural products. Retail sales in Brazil grew in March by 8.7%, and auto sales jumped by more by more than 38%, compared with the previous year.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In Peru, inflation continues to rise, reaching an annual rate of 5.4% for the eighth consecutive month, and exceeding the inflation rate established by the Andean central bank. In Colombia, the CPI reached an annual rate of 7.2%, the highest figure in five years. Although Panama has one of the lowest inflation rates in Central America, prices are growing at a faster pace than in nearly 25 years. Inflation in Panama accelerated in June to an annual rate of 9.6%. According to Torassa, “In that specific case, where they use the dollar as their currency, they have also been under inflationary pressure because of the weakness of that currency in international markets. That makes their imports, which are mostly from Europe, more expensive.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mexico</span> <span lang="EN-US">has been the strongest performer in all of Latin America. While inflation is on the rise, it continues to be very moderate. In April, both the CPI and the underlying inflation rate grew by an annual rate of 4.5%, a bit below the figure registered at the end of 2007. Although Mexico is a major producer or crude oil, it cannot avoid suffering some impact from rising prices for other commodities, notes Sebastián, but it “benefits from the excellent performance of unitary salary costs, which increased at an annual rate of only 1.4% in February. In addition, productivity is growing.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US"> </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Inflationary factors</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Beyond the peculiarities of each country, Macias notes that some factors unique to Latin America help explain the price rises. It’s not just the result of higher prices for petroleum and food. These other factors include “the exhaustion of the monetary policy model that excessively simplifies the functioning of the market and which does not account for all of its complexities.” This outbreak of inflation, he adds, “requires more creativity in monetary policy, which means going beyond controlling interest rates and the quantity of money in circulation.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span lang="EN-US">Rafael Pampillón, professor at the IE business school, emphasizes the importance of the close economic relationship with the United States. “The U.S. is suffering some significant increases in its CPI, which are the result of the expansionary monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve. And the U.S. is exporting inflation to its main trading partners, such as the countries of Latin America,” he notes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListBullet"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">The Dangers for Growth</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The steep rise in Latin American inflation will have consequences for the economies of the region. Obviously, notes Torassa, “higher inflation rates bring increased interest rates, which lead to a reduction in economic growth. Nevertheless, on this occasion Latin America is better prepared than in the past to deal with this situation successfully.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Macias explains that inflation has an especially negative impact on poor people because basic commodities are subject to the largest price increases. In addition, poor people spend a higher percentage of their incomes on products that are getting more expensive. This also has a notable impact on borrowers, he says, “especially those people who own property that has stopped rising in value. Rising inflation could also spark a new mortgage crisis. Just as companies are experiencing a significant increase in their financial costs, inflation has a recessionary impact on the economy. Inflation can produce a mortgage crisis and can lead to economic stagnation in the region.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Tuesta believes that the greatest risk is that “this could wind up leading to an inflationary spiral because of pressure to raise salaries.” Pampillon recalls that the region has enjoyed an extended period of clear sailing; some five consecutive years of strong economic growth. According to him, this phase of expansion “can come to a halt because of this very high rate of inflation and rising interest rates.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US"> </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">The Decision of the Central Banks</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">What position should central banks take to address the threat? During the 1980s, says Macias, there was an important change in Latin American economic policy that resulted from the very high levels of inflation [suffered] in earlier times. “There were a lot of changes and they were very complicated. However, one of the most important changes was that they decided to create independent central banks that had the main function of controlling inflation, to the detriment of the ‘real’ variables in the economy, such as levels of production and employment. The result was that the economic growth rate during the 1980s and 1990s was lower than the economic growth rate in earlier decades. Now, that model has been exhausted. The privilege of enjoying stability, along with monetary factors, generates serious structural problems that make it hard for the economy to grow faster.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Macias says that banks need to “coordinate their decisions with the rest of economic policy. That means allowing inflation to rise to higher-than-current levels in order to avoid causing a severe recession and an even greater increase in unemployment. Institutionally, this position is very hard for the central banks because it is outside the area where they are designed to play a role.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although any increase in the cost of money can be harmful to economic growth in the region, Tuesta believes that central banks should not renounce their chief goal of keeping inflation under control. “[Interest] rate increases must be a priority when you look for ways to control these inflationary pressures, even at the risk of recession. The history of Latin America shows that the risk of living with rising inflation is much more harmful over the long run [than recession],” he warns.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Pampillon has a very similar view. He believes that institutions that regulate monetary policy have no other choice but to raise interest rates. “It is very hard to correct an inflationary economy. Beyond that, there is a growing consensus among economists that price stability is essential for economic growth,” he says.</span></p>

<p><span>When it began, the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF) was a local retail jamboree, a month of bargains to boost the economic new year. The inaugural event, in 1996, attracted 1.6 million shoppers who spent US$584 million between late January and the end of February. "Shopping tourism" had arrived in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span>Since then, the government-supported festival has grown into a veritable World’s Fair of tax-free shopping, entertainment and cultural extravaganzas that sprawls across the emirate’s many malls, food courts, restaurants, hotels, amusements and cities within a city.</span></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><span>Organizers say it’s the tip of the spear in a broader effort to "reposition" Dubai as more than just a "seven-star" Mecca for the rich and famous. The emphasis is on more affordable shopping and travel options, which are now in demand. Merchants outdo each other with discounts that can reach 75%, and shoppers joyously cart off jewelry, perfumes, textiles, handicrafts, electronics — and even automobiles.</span></p>
<p><span>"The DSF is unlike any event in the world," says Laila Suhail, CEO of Dubai Events and Promotions Establishment. "It has grown to be among the foremost shopping events in the world, and the biggest of its kind in the region."</span></p>
<p><span>The DSF has helped shopping and tourism emerge as key pillars of the government’s strategy to make Dubai a leisure destination in the Middle East, particularly since the 2008-2009 shock knocked Dubai off its economic moorings. (The International Monetary Fund is forecasting a 0.5% contraction next year, although overall the United Arab Emirates’ economy is predicted to grow 3.1%.)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Bargain Hunters Abound</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Although the global financial crisis has humbled high-flying Dubai, it has not scared off bargain hunters or those with plenty of discretionary income. More than 3.3 million people spent US$2.66 billion at the DSF in 2009, and a slight increase (US$2.67 billion) was predicted for this year’s festival, which attracted more than 6,000 retailers, 60% of them pushing gold and silver.</span></p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><span>The DSF’s theme is "One World, One Family, One Festival." Countries erect pavilions in Dubai Village to showcase their culture and heritage through handicrafts, clothing, music and dance. Shoppers can win gold, jewelry, luxury autos and US$10,000 cash for being chosen the "Ideal Arab Mother" or "Ideal Family." There has been a circus, a perfume souk and a Bedouin-style "Family Desert Camp" (with camels and tents). There are festivals of jazz, film, dance and cartoons. The closing ceremonies rival those of the Olympics<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Targeted marketing bolstered DSF 2010, which saw a big increase in the number of amusements. For the first time, festival officials traveled to India to promote the event. "The DSF extends the concept of shopping as an exclusive experience for Indians who love to visit malls and buy branded products at attractive discounts," says Anandakuttan B. Unnithan, a professor of marketing at the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking to increase commerce during the historically slow hot months, the rulers decided to leverage the air-conditioning of their shopping palaces by adding the Dubai Summer Surprises, the summer equivalent of the DSF, 13 years ago. This year’s event opens on June 17 and runs through August 17, just before the beginning of a new school year and Ramadan. Then comes Eid in Dubai, another retail promotion marking the end of Ramadan that emerged in 2008, when the financial crisis rippled through the debt-laden emirate and emptied its malls, airplanes, hotels and luxury condos of tourists and expatriate workers.</span></p>
<p><span>Suhail says the public-private partnership is vital, even if some of the retail partners wind up being loss leaders because of steep discounts. The winners are the hotels, apartment flats, and restaurants, which would earn nothing without warm bodies in rooms or at tables. Package tours — in which airlines, hotels and tour operators get together to offer deals at various price points – have also had success. Meanwhile, the government has played a significant role in building the retail and tourism infrastructure, financed partly by the private sector: the hotels, malls, roads, airports and Metro.</span></p>
<p><span>These public-private partnerships have been essential to creating the Dubai brand, which has spawned smaller shopping festivals in the Gulf, such as the Qatar Summer Wonders event in Doha, and even in conservative Saudi Arabia, the "Riyadh Festival for Shopping and Leisure," which the local chamber of commerce claims is "</span><span>not only the residents of Riyadh but tourists from all over the world to enjoy."</span></p>
<p><strong><span>A Major Part of the Economy</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In late May, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who oversees the emirate’s airports, airlines and festivals, said that the retail festival industry had transitioned from being just entertainment into a major contributor to its economy. It’s proving to be a big driver for tourism, which accounted for nearly 40% of Dubai’s first-quarter GDP, according to government figures released last month, and about 22% of the country’s overall GDP, according to a recent r</span><span>eport by the Federation of UAE Chambers Of Commerce and Industry</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>By comparison, during the launch of the Dubai Strategic Plan in 2007, Al Maktoum acknowledged that the non-oil sector accounted for 97% of the emirates’ total GDP, compared to 67% in 1975. (Abu Dhabi’s economy, by comparison, still relies heavily on oil.)</span></p>
<p><span>Currently the eighth most-visited city worldwide, ahead of Shanghai and Rome, Dubai has drawn up plans to more than double the number of tourists it attracts annually by 2015 — 15 million a year compared with the current seven million. According to the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, in 2007, the latest year for which official numbers are available, the largest numbers of tourists came from the U.K. (752,391), followed by Iran (413,721) and India (410,821).</span></p>
<p><span>"Our main focus is on the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries, Asia and CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States], as these nationalities love to shop," says Suhail.</span></p>
<p><span>To that end, the government is pushing ahead with the Al Maktoum Airport, the world’s largest. Occupying part of the 140-square-kilometer, debt-plagued Dubai World Central, the first phase of the airport will open on June 27, Ahmed said, adding that Dubai International Airport is being expanded as well so it can handle an expected 46 million total passengers this year and 100 million by 2020.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Searching for Unique Experiences</span></strong></p>
<p><span>But competition is coming. According to Unnithan of the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and other popular destinations offer similar shopping jamborees, competing for the same set of spenders.</span></p>
<p><span>"There are cheap flights not just to Dubai but to virtually every destination in East Asia, which encourages shoppers to [seek out] unique experiences," he says. "Even [the southern Indian state of] Kerala has its own version of a shopping festival." Addressing Indian travelers specifically, Unnithan points out that in this globalized world, almost everything is available in the posh malls that have sprung up across major Indian cities.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, he is skeptical about the continuing charm of the Dubai Shopping Festival. "In the retail lifecycle," he says, "the advantages of any exclusive shopping experience are neutralized by the cost increases [for customers] over a period of time."</span></p>

						<p><em>India’s British rulers left the country in 1947. Nearly 70 years later, why is India not yet a wealthier country? According to entrepreneur Rajesh Jain and economist Atanu Dey, the reasons are manifold, but they have to do with a simple reality – that Indians are not yet economically free. “Under British rule, Indians suffered the ill effects of extractive and exploitative policies,” they note. “These policies did not change even after independence. What is worse is that socialist policies were added to an already toxic system. These need to be replaced with new, pro-growth, pro-economic freedom policies.”</em></p>
<p><em>Jain describes himself as a serial tech and political entrepreneur. He is founder and managing director of Mumbai-based Netcore Solutions, India’s leading provider of digital communications and marketing solutions via email and mobile. He also founded Niti (New Initiatives for Transforming India) Digital, which worked actively on the 2014 election campaign of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. </em></p>
<p><em>Dey, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area, is the author of </em>Transforming India<em>, a book in which he explores the causes of India’s poverty and discusses what steps India would need to take in order to become a prosperous country by 2040.</em></p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p><em>Jain and Dey visited Wharton last month to discuss their new initiative named “Free a Billion,” which refers to gaining economic freedom for a large part of India’s population. Among other steps, they believe India needs a new Constitution, which can empower people rather than the government. </em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Edited excerpts from their interview with the K@W radio show on Sirius XM (channel 111) appear below.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Is India a free country?</p>
<p>R<strong>ajesh Jain:</strong> India is not really a completely free country. Atanu will explain why.</p>
<p><strong>Atanu Dey:</strong> The potential has always been there. India is quite rich in terms of resources, both human and non-human. But, unfortunately, there are barriers to India’s growth at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What was the role of the British colonial legacy and the fact that India, even after independence in 1947, was such a highly regulated economy? What role have those factors played in keeping India poor?</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> It’s a very important question. The British legacy has been instrumental in preventing India from growing, because the British were a colonial government and a colonial government is in the business of colonizing so that it can reap economic benefits. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledge.wharton.upenn.edu%2Farticle%2Ffree-a-billion-a-way-to-lead-india-from-economic-bondage-to-prosperity%2F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknlg.net%2F1imVad0&amp;source=tweetbutton&amp;text=So%20its%20regulation%20and%20rules%2C%20the%20whole%20structure%20is%20such%20that%20it%20can%20exploit%20and%20extract%20from%20the%20economy.%20" class="fyc_printfriendly tweetthislink" target="_blank">So its regulation and rules, the whole structure, is such that it can exploit and extract from the economy.  <i class="ss-icon ss-social" style="font-size:10pt">Twitter</i> </a>At the time of India’s independence from the British, the country became politically independent, but Indians never got economic independence from the British.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> If you’re talking about just India on the global spectrum right now, where does the country stand in terms of being competitive with others?</p>
<blockquote><p>On various parameters — transparency, human development, the happiness index, ease of doing business and the index of economic freedom — India comes out poorly. <span class="attribution">–Rajesh Jain</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> India is not very competitive for some reasons. I think Rajesh will be able to address this point because he’s a businessman in India.</p>
<p>Jain: If you look at some of the numbers, in 1980, India, believe it or not, had a higher per capita income than China. Both were very small, sub-$300. Today, China’s per capita income is almost five times that of India. On various other parameters, whether it’s transparency, human development, the happiness index, the ease of doing business and, most important, the index of economic freedom, India comes out very poorly. And part of the reason is that it’s very hard to be an entrepreneur. It’s hard to do business. There are a lot of challenges. And once you constrain entrepreneurship you are not going to be very good at wealth creation and prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What are some of the constraints that entrepreneurs face? And how can they play an active role in wealth creation?</p>
<p>Dey: Let me add before Rajesh addresses that question: India is a control-permit-quota kind of place. The government has to have control over the economy. And entrepreneurs actually bring in disruptive innovation, which creates wealth. It’s the job of an entrepreneur. It doesn’t fit well under a control-and-command economy. Therefore entrepreneurship is being suppressed actively in India. But Rajesh will tell you more about it.</p>
<p>Jain: Let me give some simple examples. The time it takes for an entrepreneur to register the name of a company can run into weeks rather than being an instant process. And many times we’ve seen that you’ve actually got to pay bribes to get the name that you want cleared, even though that’s not been taken up by anyone else. Or getting income-tax refunds can take many years. In my own company, we’ve not got the money due for almost five years because people are in charge of giving the money back: it’s not automated. There is some discretion. Because they have control, they can ask for money to give our own money back.</p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> How much money are you talking about?</p>
<p>Jain: These are small amounts, but they all add up. For entrepreneurs it’s the cash-flow that is important. Hurdles are there at every stage. When you also run manufacturing units, the labor laws are a big challenge. It constrains businesses from growing. Even when you look at education, India is underinvested. India has too much control on education, with the result that it’s very hard to get high-quality talent and skill. And the corresponding part of it is that there is significant unemployment and underemployment. There was a story in the newspapers recently about 300 vacancies for a peon’s [office helper’s] job – a government job – and it attracted 2.3 million applications.</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> Including applications from some people who had college degrees. And there were some 250 people with Ph.D.s who said, “I’d rather be a peon than do nothing.”</p>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> Peon in a government organization</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> It’s really very disturbing if you think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Let us pause and take a different course in our conversation. Could you tell me a little about your own backgrounds and how that brought you to the ideas that you’re talking about?</p>
<blockquote><p>I challenge you to find a person who has read the Constitution. <span class="attribution">–Atanu Dey</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> I’m an engineer by training and moved to study computer science at the graduate level. I went to Rutgers University and got a job in Silicon Valley. While in the Valley I saw that California was rich and I didn’t understand why India was poor, because all people are the same. Then I came to the realization that it has something to do with the structure, the rules that we are governed by. It was India’s structural problem. So I studied economics at UC Berkeley, I got my Ph.D. from there. After that I started working with Rajesh. And we came to realize that we have to make structural changes. He’s an entrepreneur and can make things happen.</p>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> My background is in engineering. I started in the U.S., got my masters from Columbia University and then went back to be an entrepreneur in India. I set up India’s first internet portals in 1995, just around the time Yahoo and eBay had started. And I sold that business in November 1999 for about $100 million. It was at that time one of Asia’s largest internet deals.</p>
<p>I’ve continued since then as a serial entrepreneur. Over the past few years, I’ve become increasingly interested in seeing how we can create prosperity in India. It all started with a question that Atanu had asked me a few years ago — “Rajesh, when your son (who was three years old at that time) grows up and asks you: ‘Dad, you saw what was happening around you. You had the money; you had the time. Why didn’t you do something about it?'” From there started a different journey.</p>
<p>In 2009, I worked in the campaign of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is the current party in power. But they lost in the 2009 elections. From 2010 onwards I started working for current Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2011, I wrote a blog which articulated a strategy saying that the BJP should focus on getting a majority on its own. No political party had achieved this in India for 30 years. That’s really a different way to think. And then a year later I set up a separate team to help with the elections which were coming up in 2014. With my own money we hired 100 people to work on media, data analytics and build a volunteering platform.</p>
<p>Over the past year I’ve been thinking more deeply about the problem of the structural changes that India needs to get onto an irreversible path of freedom and prosperity. If you look at Indians in the U.S., they have 40-50 times per capita income than Indians living in India. They are the richest group in the U.S. So there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with Indians.</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> Yes. I don’t see any reason to believe that people in India are any stupider or more ignorant. It is that the government doesn’t allow them to do things. That’s the problem; Indians need economic freedom to prosper, for India to prosper.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Do you think politicians understand markets?</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> Actually they do — because they are also in the business of trading, give and take and all of that. They understand markets very well. They also would understand that markets have the power to transform and it creates wealth. But if you let the market do its stuff, then you have to be out of the business of command and control. So you can have competition in the market or competition for the market. And they prefer the competition for the market because they then extract dividends from it.</p>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> In fact, this is sort of structurally encoded in the Constitution of India. When you look at the Constitution, it’s essentially a derivative of the Government of India Act of 1935, which was set up by the British to control India. Out of 395 articles, 250 are taken from there. And India has the longest Constitution in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> Incidentally, nobody has read the Indian Constitution. Nobody. I challenge you to find a person who has read the Constitution. And I would say “That’s amazing. We have to stuff the guy and put him on display.”</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> What role would constitutional change play if you were trying to establish economic freedom?</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> You can’t take a car and change it into a boat. I believe the Constitution needs to be replaced entirely with something that actually makes economic freedom — personal freedom — a fundamental right. We do not have the right to property in India. We do not have the right to free speech. You can say what you want to say, provided the government agrees with you. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> In fact just to add to that point, one of the states in India has passed a sedition act recently. This is not 1860 that we are talking about. This is 2015. People in India just don’t realize what’s happening. There was very limited protest.</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> If you speak against the government or any of its representatives, it is sedition. That’s the way it’s defined.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Are the people there so used to this pattern going on for decades that it has become the norm for them?</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> That’s precisely right. They just don’t know that they’re not free.</p>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> I keep saying government is like air in India, it’s all around you.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Do you think prime minister Modi will be the person to make these changes, to try and evolve India into the country that it needs to be and take a huge step to become a global economic power?</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe the Constitution needs to be replaced entirely with something that actually makes economic freedom — personal freedom — a fundamental right.  <span class="attribution">–Atanu Dey</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> Absolutely. He has taken the right first steps. We have 65 years of a total mess that need to be cleaned up. I think a lot more has to be done. India needs structural change. And for that I think you have to persuade, not the political class, but the people of India, because the politicians essentially react to what people want. You have to create a demand for freedom in India. That’s what’s missing. People should want property rights, freedom of speech, economic freedom to do what they want, get the government out of a lot of areas. And the prime minister has spoken about this — that the government has no business being in business. Minimum government which ensures maximum governance. We need to take care that there’s no discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> Actually, before he became prime minister, Rajesh and I had met Modi many times. My book <em>Transforming India</em> lists a number of major changes that need to be made. It’s in the book. He has evidently read it because during his election campaign he mentioned some of these points.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> When Narendra Modi became India’s prime minister in May 2014, there was tremendous expectation, especially among business people, that this would result in a major change for entrepreneurship and business growth. Based on the past several months, to what extent have these expectations been fulfilled? Do entrepreneurs feel that there has been a fundamental change, or are there still frustrations?</p>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> People don’t see things moving as fast as they would like. There’s a lot of energy we see in the startup space, in e-commerce and linked with the internet and mobile. But that’s one sector. There are many other sectors that need this same energy. I think people have realized that there’s a systemic problem. There’s a structure that needs to be changed. For that, we first need to modernize the Constitution, because that’s where the fundamental rules are.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You have a new initiative called Free a Billion. How you see that contributing to what we have been discussing, especially in the creation of demand for economic freedom in India?</p>
<p><strong>Dey:</strong> The goal is to free a billion people. We want to make about a billion people free economically. Rajesh is going to lead that initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Jain:</strong> We need to persuade people in India that they are not free. We use technologies, smartphones, we build a volunteering community, organizers across the country. We persuade people that this is something that needs to be fought for…if you are young and you want to become rich, you don’t have to go to the U.S. We need to create an India where we can create prosperity and wealth in a single generation.</p>

						<p><img class="alignright" src="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2001/10/797_0.jpg" alt=""><font face="Verdana"><p>Economists don’t agree yet about whether the U.S. economy was in recession before Sept. 11. But just about all of them are sure it’s in a recession now, and they say the ripple effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks are making it worse.</p><p>The question is: How do you turn things around?</p><p>The Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to spark spending. President Bush has proposed a $75 billion economic stimulus package that emphasizes earlier implementation of corporate and individual tax cuts scheduled to take effect over the next few years.</p><p>Bush and many Republicans believe that reducing taxes will leave companies and citizens with more money to spend, spurring production of goods and services and creating jobs. Bush’s package, which does not yet include detailed breakdowns, would come on top of the approximately $40 million Congress has authorized in emergency spending for disaster relief and a bailout of the airlines.</p><p>Democrats say Bush’s focus on tax cuts mainly benefits the affluent and would not pump money into the economy quickly enough. They urge more help for working people, such as extended unemployment benefits, health care coverage and job training. Bush wants only about a third of the $75 billion to go to these programs.</p><p>Can government engineer an economic turnaround? And if so, what techniques work best?</p><p>The theory behind any stimulus package is to replace the demand that has been lost, says Wharton finance professor </p></font><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel.html"><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/siegel/" target="_blank">Jeremy Siegel</a></font></a><font face="Verdana">. Boosting demand should drive the economy to boost supply – to create more goods and services and restore economic growth and hiring. New government spending is, in effect, an addition to existing demand in the economy. In the same way, tax and interest-rate cuts boost “private” demand by giving businesses and consumers more to spend.</font></p><p>“When you ask, ‘Do they work?’ we don’t know how much demand is going to contract as a result of these terrorists’ attacks,” Siegel says. “If demand shrinks by $200 billion, and that’s very likely … then this $75 billion plan will only go part way towards offsetting the lost demand.”</p><p>Moreover, he says, there is no way to know how much of a tax reduction will convert into spending. “Certainly, part of it will, but not 100%.”</p><p>Indeed, some economists have argued that individuals tightening their belts against the recession have been banking the recently-mailed tax rebate checks rather than spending them, making it doubtful they would spend any new tax-cut proceeds.</p><p>Corporations, some economists say, are not likely to use low interest rates and tax savings to invest in expansion because their chief problem is overcapacity arising from excessive investment in the late 1990s. Hence, they need to spend less, not more.</p><p>To some extent, government efforts to guide the economy run afoul of the lessons of the past four decades, says Alan Beckenstein, professor of business administration at the University of Virginia’s Darden Graduate School of Business Administration. “The evidence has pretty well been that stable, consistent policies, rather than ones that attempt to time the business cycle, make a lot more sense,” he notes.</p><p>“Attempts to time the business cycle were often based on faulty forecasts and lags in implementation, so that by the time a policy got into place it was chasing the wrong phenomenon.” Beckenstein says. If there is to be an attempt to influence the economy, monetary policy, such as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts, “is the more adroit weapon.” Fiscal policy, such as tax cuts and government spending, tend not to work as well, since these approaches are slow to implement and get tangled in politics.</p><p>For any economic stimulus to work, it must take effect quickly, agrees Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/marstonr.html"><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/marstonr/" target="_blank">Richard Marston</a></font></a><font face="Verdana">. “The idea is, we need immediate relief.” Programs that provide money immediately to the less-affluent consumers satisfy this test, he says. An unemployed person, for example, is likely to quickly spend any money received in a tax rebate. It is less certain that a well-to-do person would immediately spend a tax-cut windfall.</font></p><p>Many millions of the least affluent Americans pay no federal income tax. An income tax cut would therefore not provide them with more spending money, according to Marston. But nearly all workers pay Social Security tax, so a temporary cut in this withholding could quickly translate into new spending.</p><p>Extending the period during which people can receive unemployment benefits – an approach on which Bush and the Democrats generally agree – would spur spending in the same way, Marston says. But adding on to the standard 26-week benefit period could mean the additional spending by people losing their jobs this fall would not kick in until well into 2002. That might be too late, he adds.</p><p>Timing, Marston points out, is also a problem with government-funded rebuilding, since much of that money will not be spent for years. “It’s not something that will stimulate the economy. An awful lot of that money will not be spent during the downturn. It will be spent later.” Additional spending that comes after the recovery could have a negative effect, spurring inflation, he says.</p><p>Similarly, permanent tax cuts may stimulate spending too late. The ideal approach, according to Marston, would be a temporary tax cut or spending incentive that would have value only over the period in which additional spending is needed. “Clearly, if we’re doing a tax measure what we ought to be doing is talking about something that will cause business to invest more now, and, if they don’t do it now, it goes away,” he says, adding that this could be accomplished with a temporary tax credit.</p><p>If President Bush prevails with his tax-cut proposals, how much of the cuts would result in new spending?</p><p>Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/souleles.html"><font face="Verdana">Nicholas S. Souleles</font></a><font face="Verdana"> has found that 30 to 60% of the money people receive in income tax refunds gets spent over the following three months. “That’s a relatively large effect,” he says. In another study, focusing on the income tax cuts of the Reagan years, he found that 60 to 90% of the tax savings were spent. Research done at Princeton shows that people were very likely to spend most of the money that became available after they hit the ceiling on annual Social Security withholdings, Souleles says.</font></p><p>Taxpayers thus appeared more likely to spend the relatively small tax savings they received in regular paychecks. Large refund checks apparently seemed big enough to be worth saving. The three studies suggest that the most economic stimulus would come from permanent cuts in tax withholding rather than one-time refunds, Souleles says. </p><p>Clearly, there’s no unanimous view about how a stimulus package should be designed for the current slowdown. But most experts do agree that the stimulus should come sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In June 2010, in the days leading up to Mexico’s state elections, Rodolfo Torre, a leading gubernatorial candidate from the northern state of Tamaulipas, was assassinated. He had campaigned against Mexico’s drug-related violence. Shortly thereafter, in July, drug criminals used a car bomb for the first time in the history of Mexico’s drug war and killed four people in Ciudad Juárez. In August, the bodies of 72 migrants were found in northern Mexico. They had been shot after refusing to work for a drug gang. Days later, a prosecutor and police officer investigating the crime disappeared. </p>
<p>Headlines such as these have become commonplace in today’s news stories. Yet the reasons behind this escalating violence and its broader impacts on Mexican society are not fully understood because public attention is consumed by the shocking nature of the crimes. Since the scale of the human tragedy has already been well-examined, this article focuses instead on the source of increasing drug-related violence in Mexico; its economic impact, including direct and indirect costs; and the response of the global business community.</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>Mexico produces and distributes marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine to most of the world. Its largest market, the U.S., sources 90% of its cocaine from Mexico. Drug trafficking is a lucrative activity for the Mexican cartels, generating estimated annual revenues of US$35 billion to US$45 billion for Mexico, with a profit margin of approximately 80%. For this reason, many cartels are fighting for the profits involved in producing and distributing drugs. Currently, seven powerful drug-trafficking organizations occupy different regions of Mexico — La Familia Michoacán, the Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas, the Beltrán-Leyva Organization, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Tijuana Cartel, and the Juárez Cartel.</p>
<p>Mexico’s drug trade and these cartels have existed for many decades. However, the violence related to the country’s drug trade has increased dramatically since President Felipe Calderón took office in December 2006. While previous administrations did not confront the drug trade aggressively, Calderón launched a total war, believing the increasing power of Mexico’s drug cartels poses a serious threat to the country’s security.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after taking office in 2006, Calderón deployed 36,000 national troops to nine states to destroy crops, collect intelligence, interrogate suspects, and confiscate contraband. He has also initiated a variety of public security and judicial reforms. For example, the Mexican government is working to improve the effectiveness of its federal police force, planning to hire 8,000 additional police investigators during 2010, while at the same time trying to purge the force of corruption. In August 2010, nearly 10% of the federal police were fired for failing lie detector, drug, or other tests that form the “trust control exams” designed to identify officers with ties to organized crime. </p>
<p>In addition, <em>Plataforma México, </em>a recent reform related to information management, aims to create real-time interconnectivity within Mexico’s police force by developing a national crime database to facilitate tracking drug criminals. Some of the judicial reforms include the introduction of oral trials, plea bargaining, and alternative case-resolution methods, as well as the possibility of engaging anonymous judges for drug-related prosecutions in order to increase the efficiency and safety of the judicial process. More importantly, the government is taking the punishment of convicted drug criminals seriously and has increased extraditions to the U.S.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the drug trade is not only Mexico’s problem, the U.S. has also pledged to help the country through the Mérida Initiative, an agreement under which the U.S. will provide support to Mexico and other Central American countries in their fight against drugs. Specifically, the U.S. has allocated US$1.5 billion over a three-year period to eliminate corruption within these countries’ government institutions by funding training for police forces, security-development programs, and purchases for equipment used in the war against drugs.</p>
<p><strong>New Alliances, More Violence</strong></p>
<p>Despite the efforts of Calderón’s administration and the increased cooperation between Mexico and the U.S., drug-related violence in Mexico continues to rise. An estimated 7,000 people died in Mexico in 2009 as a result of the drug war — significantly more than the 1,300 people who are believed to have died in 2005 before the war began. There were also an estimated 1,200 kidnappings in 2009. Paradoxically, Mexico’s strong stance against the cartels seems to be contributing to increased drug-related violence. While the efforts of Calderón’s administration have, indeed, weakened the cartels, the capture of key leaders has upset their dynamics as members fight for powerful and profitable leadership positions. </p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>The Mexican government’s war against drugs has also affected the distribution of power <em>among</em> the cartels as they fight to gain the rights to their now-weaker competitors’ drug routes. This fighting is so extreme that it has resulted in alliances between certain cartels in order to defeat others. For instance, <em>La nueva federación</em> is an alliance that was formed recently between La Familia Michoacán, the Gulf Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel.</p>
<p>Another likely explanation for the increase in drug-related violence is that the drug cartels are attempting to force the government to back down by terrorizing the public. As a result, violence has now spilled beyond the cartels, embroiling Mexico’s public and creating an insecure environment within Mexico, especially for businesses. The cartels now use various forms of violence against corporations — from kidnappings to theft to extortion — as a means of gaining power and profit. Pemex, the state-owned petroleum company, has been a repeated target of the cartels. In 2010, the company experienced multiple kidnappings and theft by the cartels and corrupt employees. Reuters estimates that Pemex loses “US$750 million of fuel and oil from its pipelines each year” along with “valuable spare parts and equipment.” </p>
<p>The drug cartels challenge the viability of safe and secure business environments not only for large companies such as Pemex but also for small business owners and average citizens. In July 2010, gunmen ambushed a birthday party in the Mexican state of Coahuila, killing 17 people and injuring many more. Some sources believe these mass killings were the result of the innkeeper’s not paying the extortion fees that had been demanded of him. Clearly, the carnage of Mexico’s drug war is now affecting all strata of society — from impoverished migrants to the wealthiest elite and from neighborhood businesses to Mexico’s largest firms.</p>
<p>In August 2010, the far-reaching impact of Mexico’s drug-related violence prompted Calderón to open debate on legalizing drugs. While there are differing opinions among Mexican politicians, many influential figures — including current Partido de la Revolución Democrática leader Jesús Ortega and former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Vicente Fox — believe the government’s strong stance against drugs is not working and that legalization must be explored. Their main argument is that by eliminating the black market for drugs in Mexico, the price of drugs will decrease, along with the profits and power of the cartels. Calderón has been quick to respond that the price of drugs is not determined by the market in Mexico, but by the market in the U.S., where the Mexican cartels sell the majority of their drugs. Thus, unless the U.S. also legalizes drugs, Calderón has said “it would be absurd” for Mexico to do so. He is strongly opposed to creating an environment that facilitates drug use and addiction. </p>
<p>In addition, he and some members of his administration oppose legalization due to the cartels’ pervasive influence in Mexican society. Even if drug production, distribution, and use were legalized, the cartels would likely increase other criminal activities, such as extortion and kidnapping, as a means of maintaining or boosting their earnings. Therefore, it is unlikely that legalization would affect the current levels of violence and corruption in the near future.</p>
<p>The attitudes of business leaders with operations in Mexico reflect the deteriorating conditions and suggest that insecurity has significant economic consequences. For the past two years, American Chamber Mexico (AmCham) has conducted a survey of its members — foreign and national managers — to gauge their sentiment regarding corporate and personal security: 75% say their businesses have been affected by the country’s insecurity. While their principal concerns have consistently been employee security and executive protection, other results show divergent perceptions of key issues. Nearly 60% of the respondents felt less secure on a personal level in 2009 than in 2008; but the same respondents were equally divided as to whether their respective companies were more, less, or equally secure across the same period.</p>
<p>Of the third of the respondents who viewed their companies as being less secure than the year before, the most commonly noted contributing factors were the strengthening of organized crime activity, impunity in the judicial process, and activities associated with drug trafficking. Among those who felt their companies were more secure, 25% credited the work of the Mexican authorities, while 75% attributed the improvement to the results of efforts within their own companies. Whether respondents felt their companies were better or worse off in 2009 than in 2008, there appears to be a consensus that the government is not succeeding in its efforts to provide a more secure environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of the Private Sector</strong></p>
<p>As these survey results suggest, because the government is not capable of providing adequate security, the private sector has been playing a more prominent role in this arena. The market for private security in Mexico equals 1% of GDP, or $8 billion. In response to this significant market opportunity, there are now over 10,000 private security firms compared to 6,000 15 years ago. Only 10% of these firms are professionalized, meaning they invest in training, infrastructure, technology, and analysis. Private security employs a workforce of 500,000, equal to nearly 85% of the public security sector excluding the military.</p>
<p>The most common goods and services provided by Mexican private security firms are bodyguards, electronic devices, and armored cars. The April 2010 Mexico Security Expo, a conference that showcases a wide range of the industry’s products and services, was 20% larger than the previous year’s. A conference spokeswoman illustrated the growing need for security services: “Sadly, the violence generated by organized crime has made Mexico one of the best markets for multinationals specializing in security.” In a move that reflects this sentiment, the Spanish security firm Prosegur augmented its presence in Mexico with its acquisition of a local security firm in 2009. Prosegur has seen its revenues there grow from US$1 million in 2007 to an expected US$17 million in 2010.</p>
<p>As previously noted, vehicle armoring is a principal offering of the security industry, and it is not surprising that the growth of the market is most visible in this subsector. In Latin America, the armoring market has increased by 850% in the last eight years, and Mexico is now the second largest market after Brazil. Since 2008, the number of armored cars has increased by 25% in Mexico City and by 60% in the rest of the country. This market is expected to grow by 20% in 2011. Businesses have responded to this need: There are now 70 registered providers of armoring, compared to only three 15 years ago. </p>
<p>Car manufacturers are also producing armored cars targeted toward this market. The extent to which the profile of the typical armored car owner has changed demonstrates the broad societal impact of insecurity. In 2008, CEOs of large companies were the principal users. Two years later, executives two or three levels lower in the hierarchy, as well as their family members, are using armored vehicles. The CEO of International Armoring Corp., an American firm that has seen a great increase in its shipments to Mexico and U.S. border cities, confirms that his client base is shifting: “[These cars] are made to blend in…. They are no longer only for heads of state. Our customers at the borders are normal executives who are concerned for their safety.” Even more tellingly, the 40% growth of the market for used armored vehicles and the introduction of armored versions of mainstream, affordable brands such as Chrysler and Volkswagen suggest that the need for this protection has spread beyond the elite.</p>
<p>Confronting this troubled security situation is undoubtedly costly to the Mexican government and society. Kroll estimates the direct cost of insecurity to the government, businesses, and citizens to be US$65 billion, or 8% of GDP. While the magnitude of this figure is notable on its own, when put in the context of other key economic data, it is even more striking. Also, according to Kroll’s figures, this amount represents 75% of the total income and sales taxes collected by the Mexican government, 2.5 times the inflow of remittances to the country, and 3.5 times the amount of foreign direct investments. It is twice the size of Mexico’s oil exports.</p>
<p>Violence and insecurity clearly come with negative economic consequences, even beyond the staggering direct costs. As former president Vicente Fox (2000-2006) commented recently on his website, “the magnitude of the damage [of the violence associated with the fight against organized crime] has also extended to the perception and image of the country, economic activity, particularly in tourism and foreign direct investment, as well as the formidable opportunity cost that we are paying in resources, people, and time that have to be sacrificed at the expense of other strategic areas.” President Calderón has voiced a similar sentiment, stating, “the insecurity, in general, and the information that derives from it send, not only to Mexico but to the world, a sign of violence that worsens the image of our country.”</p>
<p>Beyond the perception, though, it is difficult to quantify the economic impact. International tourism revenue, the third largest source of dollar inflows, fell 15% in 2009, the first decline in a decade. This cannot be attributed solely to a fear of violence, however, as that year saw the global economic crisis as well as the swine flu outbreak in Mexico, both of which discouraged tourism. While authorities maintain that tourist areas remain safe for visitors, there have been incidents of violence in formerly popular destinations such as Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, and Taxco.</p>
<p>It is also commonly believed that the insecurity is negatively impacting foreign direct investment, particularly as violence is increasing in Monterrey, one of the country’s principal industrial cities. Local business leaders there say that some foreign investments have been put on hold due to security concerns, but they are reluctant to give specific examples. Of course, it is impossible to identify all of the investments that would have been made had the security atmosphere been more favorable, but 27% of AmCham survey respondents indicated they had reconsidered investments in Mexico due to security issues. This figure represents the views of managers who already have ties to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is likely that negative publicity would have an even greater influence on those making the decision whether to <em>begin</em> investing in Mexico. However, capital continues to flow into the country. In fact, foreign direct investment is experiencing an impressive recovery from the economic crisis and is expected to reach 2006 levels of US$20 billion in 2010. As the director of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Comisión Económica para América Latína y el Caribe) recently noted: “What is important for an investor in regards to security has to do with legal security and country risk. In both aspects, Mexico has advanced a lot, and this is the type of security that affects the investor.”</p>
<p>This positive trend, however, should not be over-emphasized. While some progress has been made in Calderón’s fight against organized crime with the arrests and killings of key traffickers, four years into the struggle the violence is worsening, with no end in sight. An increasing proportion of AmCham respondents do not expect to see improvements in the security context within the next five years. While the private security industry is benefiting from its increased relevance, this crisis is imposing significant financial, social, cultural, and psychological costs on Mexico. Adding to the difficulty of gauging these costs, specifically in economic terms, is the reluctance of key stakeholders to speak openly and frankly about the topic. </p>
<p>Executives are understandably unwilling to discuss in detail the full extent of their security concerns and, even more so, their precautions, as such candor could make them less effective. Security consultants are similarly mum on specifics because discretion is key to the services they provide. Stakeholders with sufficient interests in the country — whether they are investors, government officials, or well-connected citizens — may be hesitant to contribute to negative perceptions of Mexico. </p>
<p>This results in starkly mixed messages: Near-daily headlines tell of torture, shoot-outs, kidnappings, and murders that should scare off tourists and investors. At the same time, some maintain that insecurity is highly regional, limited primarily to those involved in the drug trade, and is not a significant business concern. Like most such dichotomies, the truth lies somewhere in the middle — for now. The fight for security in Mexico has the potential to move the country toward one of those extremes; overcoming the drug violence, therefore, is of utmost importance to the country’s future.</p>

<p>It seems sensible: Bring leaders of the 20 largest economies together to discuss a coordinated plan for dealing with the world financial crisis. In October, when U.S. President George Bush called for the November 15 G-20 Economic Summit in Washington, D.C., some commentators likened it to the momentous Bretton Woods meeting of 1944, which set exchange-rate rules and established the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>But there has been little news coverage of the upcoming gathering since then, and it seems as if no one now expects the meeting to achieve anything sweeping. “I think it will be difficult to accomplish much given that they’ve had little time to prepare for this,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist and co-founder of Moody’s Economy.com. “It is more symbolic than substantive.”</p><div class="active friend-module-target">

<p>“The whole idea of a summit at this point is premature and potentially dangerous,” adds Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/herring.html">Richard J. Herring</a>, concerned that world leaders, eager to look like they are doing something, could move too fast to set up new policies and regulations. “Our understanding of precisely what went wrong and how it should be fixed is so incomplete.” </p>
<p>With Bush leaving office in January, this is “an awkward time in the U.S. political cycle” because the president cannot make long-term commitments, noted Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/marstonr.html"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/marstonr/" target="_blank">Richard Marston</a>. Indeed, many experts have cited Bush’s lame duck status in downplaying expectations for the summit. President-elect Barack Obama declined Bush’s invitation to attend and has scheduled his own talks with world leaders.</p>
<p>“I hope that Obama stays far away from [the summit] and that Bush is completely non-committal,” Herring says. The Europeans, he added, “have plenty to fix in the [European Union] without reinventing the world financial order.”</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding Protectionism</strong></p>
<p>The White House has said it hopes the summit leaders will establish some “general principles” for dealing with financial issues rather than try to establish firm regulations. Among the most useful principles they could adopt, says Zandi, would be an agreement to resist protectionist impulses. “One thing is … to assure everyone that countries are not going to begin erecting barriers to trade and investment. I think that’s a significant concern. As times get tough, there is going to be tremendous political pressure for countries to get more protective, and that would be very counter-productive…. It was the rise of protectionism that contributed to the Great Depression.”</p>
<p>According to Zandi, the summit attendees should signal that their central banks will continue to coordinate policy, as they have in cutting interest rates recently. Countries should also work together to prevent wild gyrations in currency exchange rates and to signal a willingness to spend money to stimulate their economies, he says. “Finally, it might be helpful if they could say collectively that if any one of them gets into trouble, they would all be there to help.” </p><div class="active sponsor-module-target">

<p>While summit leaders may look for common ground, most would probably prefer to focus on their individual financial issues, says Marston. “I suspect that each country is going to grapple with its own regulatory structure for the next couple of years. They will confer — especially the central banks — as they always do. But I am not at all sure the U.S. and the Euro area will try to coordinate policies.”</p>
<p>Still, he notes, there are some areas that may demand international policy agreement eventually. A key one: How to deal with credit-default swaps, the unregulated instruments at the heart of the crisis. These work as a kind of insurance, with the buyer paying fees and receiving a big payment if a specific event occurs. The owner of a corporate bond, for example, can buy a swap as insurance against the risk that the company defaults on its bond payments.</p>
<p>Some experts estimate that more than $60 trillion in credit-default swaps have been written. But the market is very opaque, and many banks and other companies are fearful of doing business with one another because they worry that big, unknown swap liabilities could cause counterparties to fail to live up to financial obligations.</p>
<p>A number of economists and business leaders say that such instruments should be standardized and traded on a central exchange like stocks, options or futures contracts. Some also suggest that firms which sell credit-default swaps be required to carry cash reserves to make good on obligations. There is no such requirement today. Adds Marston: “There are a few areas, like swaps, where the approach to regulation could be multinational.” </p>
<p>There will be a limit to what can be accomplished at the summit itself, however. “We’re probably going to end up with regulated exchanges on things like [credit-default swaps], but I doubt they will talk about that at the [summit],” says Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/allenf.html"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/allenf/" target="_blank">Franklin Allen</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic Concerns First</strong></p>
<p>Before countries can establish new international financial regulations, they need to deal with some domestic issues, according to Wharton finance professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/blume.html"></a><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/blume/" target="_blank">Marshall Blume</a>. “The first thing that needs to be done in the U.S. is to rationalize our regulation — before we can internationalize anything.” </p>
<p>Investors and speculators, for example, can bet on a company by buying its stock, purchasing options on that stock or taking on swaps contracts that will rise or fall in value as the company’s fortunes change. Stocks are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and options by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while swaps are unregulated. Yet trading in one of these instruments can influence values in the others.</p>
<p>While some experts have suggested swaps be regulated the way insurance policies are, Allen notes that in the U.S., insurance regulation is mainly left to the 50 states. There might need to be some superseding federal regulation before the U.S. could participate in an international regulatory regime for swaps, he says. “It would be almost impossible to coordinate international regulation with 50 states.” </p>
<p>A major difficulty with any international agreement is finding ways to prevent participants from shopping around for the country offering the most agreeable rules, he adds. Currently, for example, companies look at accounting and other rules before deciding where to list their stock — in New York, London or elsewhere. Some countries may object to new international standards that would make it harder for them to compete for securities listings and other business, and many countries would refuse to bow to any international authority, Blume predicts. “As a political matter, I can’t see the U.S. giving up any regulatory authority to an international body. But we can <em>coordinate</em> with international bodies.”</p>
<p>Meaningful coordination is already occurring even without an economic summit or new regulatory system, Blume notes. Many central banks have cut interest rates, pumped money into their banking systems and either announced economic stimulus plans, as China has, or started talking about them seriously, as in the U.S. “They seem to be somewhat coordinated now, and that seems to be a good thing. We just have to make sure that these channels of cooperation remain open.” </p>
<p><strong>Too Much Market Freedom?</strong></p>
<p>Some coordination will need to continue for the long term, not just for the duration of this crisis, Allen argues, pointing to market volatility sparked by rapid changes in exchange rates and vast differences in interest rates from country to country.</p>
<p>While it is not clear that there should be a rigid set of international financial regulations, some updating is clearly needed, Allen maintains. He notes that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are dominated by Europeans and Americans. “They need to involve the Asians more,” he says, pointing out that China and Japan have vast resources that could be contributed to IMF and World Bank programs.</p>
<p>While it may be too early to address international banking regulations such as Basil II Accords, these should eventually be reexamined with an eye toward controlling the risk-taking that caused problems for both the investment and commercial banks, Allen adds. “We need to start from scratch.”</p>
<p>Indeed, he predicts an international reexamination of the most fundamental kind: How free should free markets be? “We’re stuck in this ideology of the past 20 years, which is that markets work and you should leave things to the markets,” Allen says, arguing that the current crisis shows there is such a thing as too much market freedom.</p>
<p>This fall, a number of governments have taken stakes in banks they have bailed out, and they have generally described these moves as temporary. But banking may work better with some permanent form of public-private partnership, with government guarantees shoring up confidence in the banking system, Allen suggests. </p>
<p>But such far-reaching issues are for the future, not the November 15 summit, he says. “People really haven’t started thinking about this at all.”</p>
